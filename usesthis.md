Inspired by [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/), the tools, services, and techniques I'm using to get things done

Hardware

MacBook Pro (Space Grey, 15-inch, 2018)

Work computer. Use it as my personal device too ;)

One Plus 5

The best bang for the buck. The size is just perfect, as well as the button feedback, and being able to unlock it with Touch ID. The screen and performance have no equal, and the camera quality is incredible

Apple In-Ear Headphones

Borrowing from my girlfriend till I get my own :)
