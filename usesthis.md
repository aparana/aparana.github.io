Inspired by [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/), the tools, services, and techniques I'm using to get things done

## Hardware

+ [MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018)](https://www.apple.com/in/mac/compare/): Work computer provided by [Go-Jek](https://www.go-jek.com/)

+ [MacBook Air (13-inch, 2013)](https://www.apple.com/in/mac/compare/): Wife's old laptop that I use as my personal computer

+ [One Plus 5](https://www.oneplus.in/5): The best bang for the buck

+ [Sony WH-1000XM3](https://www.amazon.in/Sony-WH-1000XM3-Wireless-Cancellation-Headphones/dp/B07HZ8JWCL): Best noise cancelling headphones out there in 20-30K INR price range

+ Kindle Paperwhite (Wi-fi model): I bought it in 2015. It is probably my most prized possession

+ [Apple iPad (Wi-Fi, 32GB)](https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPad-Tablet-Wi-Fi-Space/dp/B07C4YKR3J): I spent months agonising over whether to buy it or not. It has turned out to be money well spent. Super helpful for creating rough mocks & also take notes during meetings

+ [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/in/apple-pencil/): Bought it along with with my iPad. It has been a life changer. Super helpful to create handwritten notes & also draw on Procreate (when you are in the mood for it)

+ [Mika Study Chair](https://www.urbanladder.com/products/mika-study-chair): Worth the price

+ [Mi Smart Band 4](https://www.mi.com/in/mi-smart-band-4/): I took a lot of time deciding between this and a Fitbit. TBH I am quite happy with this one
