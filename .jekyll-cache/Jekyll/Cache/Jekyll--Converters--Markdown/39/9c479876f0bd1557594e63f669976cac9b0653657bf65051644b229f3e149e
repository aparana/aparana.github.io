I"¤<p>A framework for career progression: <strong>HOW -&gt; WHAT -&gt; WHY</strong></p>

<p>From implementation details to what to implement to Why you are implementing this in the first place</p>

<p>Goal should be to reach a position where you can tell the WHY instead of doing the HOW</p>

<p>Lets take an example of my own growth according to the HOW -&gt; WHAT -&gt; WHY framework</p>

<p><strong>Before:</strong> As a beginner PM I used to be obsessed with firing the right analytics events, combining multiple events and turning them into a parameter instead of a different event</p>

<p><strong>Now:</strong> Before I even define the events and parameters, I ask WHAT are the questions we are TRYING to answer here with this feature or experimentâ€™s launch and WHY are we launching this in the first place</p>
