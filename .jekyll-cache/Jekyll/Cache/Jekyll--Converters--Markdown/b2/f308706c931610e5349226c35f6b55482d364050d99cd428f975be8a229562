I"W<p>I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-brF6SUXbns">Day in the Life of a Facebook Software Engineer</a> by Patrick Shyu, and could relate from the points he makes from 4.30 to 7.30 min in the video.</p>

<p>If you are someone who has been dreaming about working for a FANG or even a late-stage startup (1000+ employees), you should ask yourself if you are okay with some of the things which you will have to do as part of the job.</p>

<p>Note: I think a lot of videos Patrick makes are kinda lame and clickbaity. I disagree with most of his content on diversity. Also he got fired from Facebook, so his videos are biased against the company. But once in a while, he throws a video like this which makes you think.</p>
