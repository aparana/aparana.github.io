I"¥<p>I wrote a thread yesterday on how I lead a Pareto life. Turning it into a blogpost (with some minor edits)</p>

<p><strong>/threadstarts</strong></p>

<p>I hate using my brain too much. I believe in doing the least amount of work to get max output</p>

<p>Here is how I have perfected a life of 80/20</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>My personal life run on <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/15/personal-OKRs-2020.html">OKRs which I plan during the beginning of the year</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Professional based on weekly goals set with my Manager on Monday mornings, and with team on Tuesdays</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have created frameworks so that my team can arrive at decisions with or without my help</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frameworks for everything: <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/25/career-frameworks.html">Career</a>, <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/26/personal-life-frameworks.html">Personal life</a>, <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/03/08/how-to-learn.html">How to learn</a>, <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/02/02/learning-football.html">Even learning football</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Templates for everything. I hated sending out product update mails earlier because I always ended up spending a lot of time on the mail template. Now that <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/28/sending-product-update-mail.html">I have a template</a> which I can reuse for all my mails, I just copy paste the content and I am done in an hour instead of taking days like earlier</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After templates, and frameworks, comes processes. I love optimising my workflow. <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/29/retrospectives.html">Link to how I run retrospectives at work</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever I get more than a dozen questions on the same topic, <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/17/twitter-rules.html">I write a blogpost</a> so that I donâ€™t have to reply the same thing again and again</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My goal in H1â€™2020 is to complete all the templates here: <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/23/running-product-team.html">How to run a product team</a>, so that I can productise my job and get involved only in high leverage activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You might think coming up with the templates above took a lot of time. Nope. I just saw how PMs in my company run their processes. Which templates they use. How they send mails. Their work practices. Then I mixed the ones I liked with dozens of processes/templates from my previous companies, and suddenly, without putting in a lot of effort, I had my own processes, templates and frameworks. Just copy shit. There is no need to reinvent the wheel</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This website? I have been following various personal blogs for years now. I just kept bookmarking the ones I liked into a folder called â€˜Personal Website Ideasâ€™. When I wanted my own site,  without putting in a lot of effort, I just mixed the look and feel of a few of my favourite ones, to come up with one I liked. I had the blog ready in days</p>
  </li>
  <li>Content which I post here as well as social media?
    <ul>
      <li>Blog: I just think of things I would have liked to read when I was starting out in my career, and I just write about those things on my blog. Keep it simple</li>
      <li>Twitter jokes: I just go to Linkedin, see people do dumb shit, and share my own take</li>
      <li>Twitter threads: I just make up those on the go. Like I am doing now. I have no idea how this would shape up when I started. And how this would end. If I like the output, I will put it on my blog</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I barely edit my tweets before posting. It is something which is a waste of time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people think I put a lot of time on Twitter. TBH I donâ€™t. I wrote this entire thread in 5 mins, and now I will move on to my next meeting</p>
  </li>
  <li>This is the beauty of optimising on <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/01/getting-shit-done-happiness.html">processes over tools</a></li>
</ul>
