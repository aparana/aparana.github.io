I"&<p>Before Slack became Slack, I was working for a startup which wanted to transform enterprise collaboration. The team had spent a couple of years developing the entire platform. Our main focus was on security and access control, and we were quite bullish regarding our initial launch. We had all the features Slack later launched with minus their integrations. Slack ended up launching before us and became the toast of the town. Slack was fun. Slack made enterprise products sexy. And for the first time people had their hands an enterprise product which did not look ‘enterprise’y. We made a lot of mistakes; but I still feel our biggest one was waiting for too long, iterating our product again and again based on whims and fancies, and finally letting another competitor come and eat our pie.</p>
