I"Û<p><strong>Controversial opinion:</strong> If you have a distribution advantage there is no shame in copying competitorsâ€™ features</p>

<p>I think Instagram copying Snapchat was the right thing</p>

<p>And Microsoft should just shamelessly copy Slackâ€™s features without trying to be original</p>

<p>Most companies I know spend a lot of time iterating on <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/2013/09/26/products.html">showstopper</a> features, which every competitor has already, compared to focusing on <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/2013/09/26/products.html">gamechangers</a>. Please donâ€™t!</p>

<p>Example. If you are a music streaming company launching today, instead of trying to be original with the Profile section, or with how the Like button should look, focus on creating a game changing feature like Spotifyâ€™s Discover Weekly (Not the UI but the algorithm which powers it)</p>

<p>Coming to Spotify, Every company is a tech company nowadays. But there are only a few like Spotify who are actually leveraging tech (their recommendations) to build a 10X better product, and thereby making Tech is their moat</p>
