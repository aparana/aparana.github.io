I"F<p>A few people have asked me how <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/11/01/personal-OKRs-update-2019.html">I manage to do so many things in a year</a> when it feels like I am 24*7 on twitter </p>

<p>I have written about my workflow <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2016/01/14/11-habits-change-life.html">here</a>, <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/03/05/55-books-read.html">here</a>, <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/03/08/how-to-learn.html">here</a> and <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/11/24/build-measure-learn.html">here</a>, and <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/03/07/macro-micro-learning.html">here</a></p>

<p>I guess most of the things mentioned in the posts above are tactical. They don’t talk about why and how I do certain things. This post talks about some of the concepts I learned in the last decade, which have not only helped me get more shit done but also improve my overall happiness</p>

<p><strong>1/ Opportunity costs</strong></p>

<p>Think about opportunity costs of everything you do</p>

<p>Most people never realise that saying YES to one thing means saying NO to another</p>

<p><strong>A few examples:</strong></p>

<p>While commuting to office: you can either daydream, watch what your friends are doing on Instagram, or read a book/listen to a podcast</p>

<p>I always somehow lean towards a new podcast episode</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong> Because learning what my friends did on their weekend on Instagram doesn’t add any value to my life. So why waste my time in the first place?</p>

<p>Okay, I don’t even have Instagram but you get my point</p>

<p>Same with jobs, friendships and everything else </p>

<p>Whenever I am asked by someone to do something, I always wonder if this thing would be more value add than my planned default activity. If the answer is No, I pass</p>

<p><strong>2/  10/10/10</strong>  </p>

<p>I prefer picking up/ doing things which I know will make me happy in 10 mins, 10 months and 10 years.
Also things which I won’t regret in the same time frames</p>

<p>Listening to podcasts makes me happy now. It would make me happy 10 years later too. I won’t regret spending hours listening to smart people talk about their ideas</p>

<p>Same with Reading. Since I was a kid, reading books has been the constant source of happiness. I will never ever regret reading more books</p>

<p>I also keep trying/learning new things every year because it gives me something new to look forward every day. Adds a bit of variance to my life</p>

<p>Playing Poker makes me happy (at least when I am winning ;)). But would I regret spending 1000s of hours on Poker 10 year later? The answer is <strong>Maybe</strong></p>

<p>Hence it is something I do from time to time but not everyday</p>

<p><strong>3/ Saying No</strong></p>

<p>I have become pretty good with saying No. I rarely commit to social events. In the last decade I have probably attended 1 marriage, that too of a first cousin who was super insistent on me attending</p>

<ul>
  <li>Birthday events? Nope</li>
  <li>Meeting random relatives who I don’t care about? Nope</li>
  <li>Attending parties where a bunch of strangers chit chat over beer and keep asking “so whats up”? Nope</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on my limited experience of attending social events, I would just sit in a corner and read a book or shit post on Twitter. So why make me as well as the host uncomfortable</p>

<p>Surprisingly the people who I consider friends have still been with me in spite of my idiosyncrasies</p>

<p><strong>4/ Sunk cost fallacy</strong></p>

<p>It is a big trap. Don’t fall for it</p>

<p><strong>Learn to let go of things when you see diminishing returns</strong></p>

<p>I was the representative of my hostel in college. I spent my entire 2nd year in building connections, student politics, aiming for a bigger role in the student council. When I realised it was just a giant waste of time, I stopped caring about politics and moved on</p>

<p>In college, I also used to run a satire site called <a href="http://tamatarnews.blogspot.com/2011/09/shocking-news-gajalaxmi-anda-stall-wins.html#comment-form">Tamatar news</a> . It was the ‘thing’ in my college. I did it for a year. In spite of people leaving <a href="http://tamatarnews.blogspot.com/2011/09/shocking-news-gajalaxmi-anda-stall-wins.html?showComment=1315850507806#c2391655012539473911">reviews like these</a> I stopped when I no longer found joy in blogging</p>

<p>I did my undergrad in Computer Science. I was a dev for more than a year. Then the day I realised I was ready to move to Product I left coding </p>

<p>I was one of the top 50 most followed Indians on Quora once. 1000s of upvotes on whatever shit I used to write. Then one fine day I woke up and realised giving life advice to 15 year olds is not something I want to spend the rest of my life on. And I left. Deleted all my answers. Never looked back</p>

<p>Used to be a travel blogger once. Not anymore</p>

<p>Seriously considered doing standup comedy a couple of years back. Planned for it by testing my material on facebook. Left because I realised being judged by 50-100 people during an open mic event is not something which would make me happy </p>

<p>I spent 6 months player Poker every day. Apart from my day job it was all I did. I won 1.5 Lakhs over 7 hours by finishing 2nd in a tournament, and also lost 30K in a single night (not the same night ;). I was doing pretty decent but I realised with every passing day I was getting diminishing return on my happiness from playing poker. And there was nothing new to learn. And I stopped. I play sometimes. But don’t spend hours everyday on it</p>

<p>Same with Fifa. Played it for years. Have not bought Fifa 20 till now. Don’t plan to play online anymore</p>

<p>One day I will realise Twitter is a giant waste of my time, and I will just pick up something new to spend my time on</p>

<p><strong>I have probably picked up, and left more things than most people who are in my age group</strong>. But each new thing helped me learn something about myself. And gave me a fleeting sense of happiness if not permanent. So I don’t regret anything</p>

<p><strong>So 4 high level strategies/thoughts for this year: Evaluate Opportunity cost, Think 10/10/10, Saying No, Don’t fall for Sunk Cost fallacy</strong></p>
