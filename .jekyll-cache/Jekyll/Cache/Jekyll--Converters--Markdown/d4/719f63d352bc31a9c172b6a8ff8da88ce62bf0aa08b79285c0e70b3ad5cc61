I"%<p>Leading mobile apps at Craftsvilla was my 2nd job in product management. I maintained a <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/11/24/build-measure-learn.html">learnings doc</a> at the job. Sharing the notes from there with minor edits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always measure the performance of campaigns.</li>
  <li>Every action should be measurable. If you are making a product change or implementing a growth idea you should write down the quantitative impact it might have.</li>
  <li>Always ask for a date for open items. Never leave a meeting without a follow-up mail with action items and a date on deliverables.</li>
  <li>Do optimization for tablets. Don’t forget a platform just because your users are on Mobile.</li>
  <li>Analyze traffic from various acquisition channels daily.</li>
  <li>Optimise push notification opens. Check the open rate for notifications you are sending.</li>
  <li>Before you make decisions based on some dashboard make sure the data is correct everywhere. I took a long time to realize session data on GA was not right.</li>
  <li>Be more proactive in putting ideas across. The ‘rate us prompt’ could have been implemented far earlier. Just because you discuss an idea don’t assume it will be implemented.</li>
  <li>Don’t wait for the next big release to club design fixes. Whenever you find a <a href="http://www.vanschneider.com/the-broken-window-theory/">broken window</a>, fix it.</li>
  <li>Make small design fixes live as soon as you can.</li>
  <li>Don’t outsource development.</li>
  <li>Don’t do big resigns and rewrites together.</li>
  <li>Talk to actual customers and not fellow employees to understand customer behavior.</li>
  <li>Keep asking if the information architecture of every page is right. The first fold of a PDP should have enough information for a user to make the purchase if he wants. Put all critical info at the top. Don’t make the user search for it.</li>
  <li>Before adding a new process understand its cost and ROI.</li>
  <li>Always make sure you have 1-1s. Don’t get lazy and skip them. 1-1s are not optional.</li>
  <li>If you have a major sales campaign coming up don’t make a deployment one day before.</li>
  <li>Don’t push anything on Prod which has not gone through the entire testing loop.</li>
  <li>Always provision for important messages on the home page. If you are having a Diwali sale and want to communicate that there might be delays, then you should have had to make an app release. There should be a toggle to turn on these messages.</li>
  <li>There should be one CTA per product card. Example. Don’t add both View and Share product CTAs coming up prominently on the card.</li>
  <li>Move to a design system over time. The website should not look drastically different from your app. CTA button colors should not vary drastically across the product.</li>
  <li>Wrestle with reality. Be optimistic, but know the ground reality. PR is not reality.</li>
  <li>Never say anything about a person you would not say to them directly.</li>
  <li>Create a culture where it is OK to make mistakes but unacceptable not to identify, analyze, and learn from them.</li>
  <li>Always learn from your mistakes. Set up processes to avoid repeated mistakes.</li>
  <li>Ask whether you have earned the right to have an opinion. Do your homework.</li>
  <li>Take notes in a meeting and share with all stakeholders. The notes taker can drive the agenda.</li>
  <li>Have a clear owner for each meeting and send the agenda before the meeting.</li>
  <li>Find a short-term resolution of the issue. Don’t wait too long to fix a production issue. RCA can happen later. Also, figure out the steps for long-term solutions. Have clear owners for action items.</li>
  <li>Have morning standups. Late day standups don’t work.</li>
  <li>Give projects names.</li>
  <li>Have Friday demos.</li>
  <li>Always keep an eye out for tactics that have not yet succumbed to the law of shitty click-throughs.</li>
  <li>Run cheap tests to validate your hypotheses.</li>
  <li>Always have goals. Where do you want to be after a year?</li>
  <li>Write documentation.</li>
  <li>Images are better than words. Showing is better than telling. Working prototypes &gt; Marvel prototypes &gt; Images &gt; Documents &gt; Verbal. Add screenshots to your documents.</li>
  <li>Capture all important decisions in a doc and make sure all key stakeholders have opted-in.</li>
  <li>Hire people better than you.</li>
  <li>If your retention strategy is changing the notice period from 1 to 3 months notice then you might have already failed as a company.</li>
  <li>Send welcome emails for new recruits. Create a 30 days plan for them.</li>
  <li>Think JTBD while designing.</li>
  <li>Do regular research.</li>
  <li>Every week go through play store reviews to understand the sentiment of customers. Don’t use generic replies for customer complaints. It is the easiest way to lose trust.</li>
  <li>Optimise your Playstore page to improve top of the funnel acquisition.</li>
</ul>
