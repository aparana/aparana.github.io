I"©<p><strong>I had recently written a twitter thread on gamification/streaks on Insight Timer, a meditation app. Turning it into a blogpost</strong></p>

<p><strong>/threadstarts</strong></p>

<p>Most apps donâ€™t let you continue your streak unless you complete the task</p>

<p>There were times when after meditating for 15 mins if the session was for 20 mins, I would just let the clock continue till the task completed</p>

<p>Why? Because I wanted to see which days I was meditating</p>

<p>In the app developerâ€™s mind, the reward (adding to your streak) should be possible only if you really complete your task</p>

<p>While for me the JTBD was to use the app as a tracker for the days I meditated</p>

<p>There was obviously a disconnect</p>

<p>Hence I found it interesting that <a href="https://insighttimer.com/">Insight timer</a> now lets you mark your session as â€˜finishedâ€™ even before the session actually ends</p>

<p>And it also adds to your streak</p>

<p>Data points they might have used:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>People who keep abandoning sessions midway do so because they choose a session longer than their level. Hence it is fair if they want to mark their session as complete if they do X% of the session</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They must have run an A/B and seen that people who get their partially completed sessions counted as finished added to their streaks, continue to come back to maintain their streak. They also do X meditations/ week vs the control</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, meditation even partially done &gt; not doing at all. And you should reward your users for coming back every day even for the sake of maintaining a streak/gamification</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I found this decision interesting and wonder if other apps will follow what Insight Timer has done</p>
