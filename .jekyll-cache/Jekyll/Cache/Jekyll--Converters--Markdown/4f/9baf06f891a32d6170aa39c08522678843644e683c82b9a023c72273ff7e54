<ul>
  <li>10.45-10.55 AM = Booking experience streamâ€™s stand-up</li>
  <li>11.00-11.10 AM = Booking flexibility streamâ€™s stand-up</li>
  <li>Everyone including the PM talks about what they did the previous day, the plan for the current day, as well as blockers in their work</li>
  <li>Only in exceptional cases, the stand-up extends to talk about the blockers. And only the relevant people stay back</li>
  <li>If there is a longer meeting needed to close the blocker/open item, then a separate meeting is scheduled in the day</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ipm">IPM</h2>

<p>I run weekly Iteration Planning Meetings (IPMs) for the sub-streams I run inside the Transport team of Gojek. There are multiple ways to run an IPM. Here is how I do it</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tuesday 11.30 AM - 12.30 PM = Booking experience streamâ€™s IPM</li>
  <li>Wednesday 11.30 AM - 12.30 PM = Booking flexibility streamâ€™s IPM</li>
  <li>Since I canâ€™t show you my own sheets, please go through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbGVvFG4bPkazM-7AJb4Ukjv7X4Ho8oZStT1lJX23sI/edit#gid=0">sheets in the fake Twitter PM sheet</a></li>
  <li>First 15 mins of the IPM, we do a <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/29/retrospectives.html">retrospective</a></li>
  <li>We close the sprint, check the velocity and add it to the Retro doc</li>
  <li>In the next 10 mins, we go through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbGVvFG4bPkazM-7AJb4Ukjv7X4Ho8oZStT1lJX23sI/edit#gid=642287720">projects prioritization &amp; allocation sheet</a>. I like to make sure the priorities of each team member is clear. Note that this sheet only contains projects under development. It is a subset of the projects mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbGVvFG4bPkazM-7AJb4Ukjv7X4Ho8oZStT1lJX23sI/edit#gid=1191664602">product development checklist sheet</a></li>
  <li>The next 5 mins involve quickly updating the team on the status of the projects in the pipeline, and not under dev; go through the product development checklist</li>
  <li>I request the TL/EM to update the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbGVvFG4bPkazM-7AJb4Ukjv7X4Ho8oZStT1lJX23sI/edit#gid=203120845">team work view sheet</a></li>
  <li>I open the floor for team members to discuss blockers if any</li>
  <li>Most of the times we are done within 40-45 mins. In that case, I end the meeting early. I hate doing meetings for the sake of it, and instead of expanding the meeting to fit the time slot, I prefer people going back to their work</li>
  <li>Note that we donâ€™t discuss Jira during the IPM. For me as a PM, I generally just care about whether we are meeting timelines for each milestone of the project. I donâ€™t like obsessing over each story of a sprint. I let the developers cut their own stories with their TL. Over planning a sprint as well as micromanaging on a daily level has never given me any joy</li>
  <li>I update all the trackers that I maintain async. Read my rules for <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/04/26/rules-project-management.html">Project management</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sprints">Sprints</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One week sprints</li>
  <li>Backlog grooming meeting 1 day before IPM</li>
  <li>Dev stories created by devs</li>
  <li>Estimation of stories done jointly by dev and TL</li>
  <li>Stories added to backlog</li>
  <li>Jira board divided into
    <ul>
      <li>Up next</li>
      <li>Blocked</li>
      <li>In progress</li>
      <li>Code review/Pending deployment</li>
      <li>Pending in QA</li>
      <li>Done/ In Production</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Blocked = Any card which is blocked due to dependency on external teams, or some other reason</li>
  <li>Done = Shipped to Production</li>
  <li>Moving something to Integration != Done</li>
  <li>Epics map to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RvslTOIHBHknK54ftASaHcFEnK4ytueJ5_4jCjvDZkg/edit?usp=sharing">Dev milestones</a></li>
  <li>Sprints are independent or milestones, which in turn are independent of client releases</li>
  <li>Milestones for a feature might stretch across multiple sprints</li>
  <li>Completed features get shipped in the next release</li>
</ul>
