I"â<p>While reading <a href="https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/06/06/always-day-one-alex.html">Always Day One</a>, I remembered this post on <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/how-mark-zuckerberg-led-facebooks-war-to-crush-google-plus">how Zuckerberg led Facebookâ€™s war to crush Google Plus</a>, which I had read a few years back.</p>

<p>I realised that Mark Zuckerberg is the ultimate war time CEO who</p>
<ul>
  <li>grew up idolizing Caeser and playing strategy games</li>
  <li>super competitive</li>
  <li>announces lockdowns when under threat</li>
  <li>wants to crush enemies, takes no prisoners</li>
  <li>evokes his inner Roman orator, and shouts â€˜Carthago delenda estâ€™</li>
</ul>

<p>For you it might be coronavirus, and not Google, which is an existential threat. Reading this blogpost will give you valuable insights on how to fight it.</p>
