I"<#<p>These are my notes from Managing Oneself by Peter F. Drucker. Drucker was an Austrian-born American management consultant, educator, and author, whose writings contributed to the philosophical and practical foundations of the modern business corporation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most people think they know what they are good at. They are usually wrong. <strong>The only way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis.</strong> Whenever you make a key decision or take a key action, write down what you expect will happen. Nine or 12 months later, compare the actual results with your expectations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practiced consistently, this simple method will show you within a fairly short period of time, maybe two or three years, where your strengths lie — and this is the most important thing to know. The method will show you what you are doing or failing to do that deprives you of the full benefits of your strengths. It will show you where you are not particularly competent. And finally, it will show you where you have no strengths and cannot perform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here are some of the steps to do well in your career</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, <strong>concentrate on your strengths</strong>. Put yourself where your strengths can produce results. Second,<strong>work on improving your strengths</strong>. Analysis will rapidly show where you need to improve skills or acquire new ones. It will also show the gaps in your knowledge — and those can usually be filled</p>

<p>Third, <strong>discover where your intellectual arrogance is disabling ignorance and overcome it</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If analysis shows that someone’s brilliant work fails again and again as soon as cooperation from others is required, it probably indicates a lack of courtesy — that is, a lack of manners. Try to improve on how you deal with people and work on improving your collaborative skills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>There are two kinds of people: Listeners and Readers.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Few listeners can be made, or can make themselves, into competent readers — and vice versa. The listener who tries to be a reader will, therefore, suffer the fate of Lyndon Johnson, whereas the reader who tries to be a listener will suffer the fate of Dwight Eisenhower. They will not perform or achieve. Try to figure who you are.</p>

<p>The explanation for above is that <strong>writers do not, as a rule, learn by listening and reading. They learn by writing.</strong> Because schools do not allow them to learn this way, they get poor grades. There are people, like Churchill, who learn by writing. Some people learn by taking copious notes. Beethoven, for example, left behind an enormous number of sketchbooks, yet he said he never actually looked at them when he composed. Asked why he kept them, he is reported to have replied, “If I don’t write it down immediately, I forget it right away. If I put it into a sketchbook, I never forget it and I never have to look it up again.” <strong>Some people learn by doing. Others learn by hearing themselves talk.</strong></p>

<p>A chief executive (who Drucker knew) who converted a small and mediocre family business into the leading company in its industry was one of those people who learn by talking. He was in the habit of calling his entire senior staff into his office once a week and then talking at them for two or three hours.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Am I a reader or a listener? and How do I learn? are the first questions to ask. But they are by no means the only ones. To manage yourself effectively, you also have to ask, <strong>Do I work well with people, or am I a loner?</strong> <strong>And if you do work well with people, you then must ask, In what relationship?</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do I produce results as a decision maker or as an adviser?</strong> A great many people perform best as advisers but cannot take the burden and pressure of making the decision. A good many other people, by contrast, need an adviser to force themselves to think; then they can make decisions and act on them with speed, self-confidence, and courage. This is a reason, by the way, that the number two person in an organisation often fails when promoted to the number one position. The top spot requires a decision maker. Strong decision makers often put somebody they trust into the number two spot as their adviser — and in that position the person is outstanding. But in the number one spot, the same person fails. He or she knows what the decision should be but cannot accept the responsibility of actually making it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be able to manage yourself, you finally have to ask, <strong>What are my values?</strong> Organizations, like people, have values. <strong>To be effective in an organisation, a person’s values must be compatible with the organisation’s values. They do not need to be the same, but they must be close enough to coexist.</strong> Otherwise, the person will not only be frustrated but also will not produce results. Or rather, they should be able to decide where they do not belong. The person who has learned that he or she does not perform well in a big organisation should have learned to say no to a position in one. The person who has learned that he or she is not a decision maker should have learned to say no to a decision-making assignment</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accept the fact that other people are as much individuals as you yourself are. They perversely insist on behaving like human beings. This means that they too have their strengths; they too have their ways of getting things done; they too have their values. <strong>To be effective, therefore, you have to know the strengths, the performance modes, and the values of your coworkers.</strong> That sounds obvious, but few people pay attention to it. Typical is the person who was trained to write reports in his or her first assignment because that boss was a reader. Even if the next boss is a listener, the person goes on writing reports that, invariably, produce no results. Invariably the boss will think the employee is stupid, incompetent, and lazy, and he or she will fail. But that could have been avoided if the employee had only looked at the new boss and analysed how this boss performs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The same holds true for all your coworkers. Each works his or her way, not your way. And each is entitled to work in his or her way. What matters is whether they perform and what their values are. As for how they perform — each is likely to do it differently. The first secret of effectiveness is to understand the people you work with and depend on so that you can make use of their strengths, their ways of working, and their values. Working relationships are as much based on the people as they are on the work</p>

<p>The second part of relationship responsibility is taking responsibility for communication. Whenever Drucker, or any other consultant, start to work with an organisation, the first thing he hears about are all the personality conflicts. Most of these arise from the fact that people do not know what other people are doing and how they do their work, or what contribution the other people are concentrating on and what results they expect. And the reason they do not know is that they have not asked and therefore have not been told.</p>

<ul>
  <li>After 20 years of doing very much the same kind of work, people are very good at their jobs. But they are not learning or contributing or deriving challenge and satisfaction from the job. And yet they are still likely to face another 20 if not 25 years of work. <strong>That is why managing oneself increasingly leads one to begin a second career.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There are three ways to develop a second career.</p>

<p>The first is actually to start one.</p>

<p>The second way to prepare for the second half of your life is to develop a parallel career.</p>

<p>Finally, there are the social entrepreneurs. These are usually people who have been very successful in their first careers. They love their work, but it no longer challenges them. In many cases they keep on doing what they have been doing all along but spend less and less of their time on it. They also start another activity, usually a nonprofit.</p>

<p><strong>To summarise:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use “feedback analysis” to discover and focus on your strengths</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Determine who you are: a reader or a listener, decision maker or an advisor?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think about your values</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn about your colleagues just like you learn about yourself</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think about your second career once you have spent 20–25 years in your industry</p>
  </li>
</ul>
