  <li>Donâ€™t look at UI components in isolation.</li>
  <li>As a PM, I care less about a new search boxâ€™s UI and itsÂ functionalities than how theÂ search experience will fit in the customer journey.</li>
  <li>Say you are a designer/PM designing the search experience for a dashboard. Focus less on what features the search box will have, be it autocomplete, suggestions, full text search vs partial etc, and more on why and how the search will be used by the user. Understand what job the user is trying to accomplish while using search.</li>
  <li>MVP design is not about features. It is about what job stories you want to tackle as part of the v1.</li>
  <li>Have an opinion; this is true for both the presenter and the reviewer. Reviews should not be able superficial compliments and backslapping. It should be about constructive feedback and how we can make the product even better.</li>
  <li>You want the user to perform a series of actions to complete a job they have hired your feature for. Donâ€™t hide your lack of opinion by suggesting 3 random alternatives to the reviewer or asking the PM to run an A/B test to figure out the best UI.</li>
