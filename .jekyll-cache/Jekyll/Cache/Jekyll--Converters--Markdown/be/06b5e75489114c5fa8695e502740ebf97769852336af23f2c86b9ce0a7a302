I"H<p>Every time I go on LinkedIn, I see posts which annoy me to no end. Sometimes it is by the same people</p>

<p>I know that a lot people here might feel the same about me</p>

<p>Hence I keep recommending people to unfollow me</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/unfollow_me.png" alt="Unfollow me" /></p>

<p>This is not me flexing. I have never understood following people, then rage commenting on his posts about something he posted</p>

<p>I rarely comment on other people’s posts. If I don’t like someone, I block or mute him</p>

<p>I don’t come here for debates or discussions. This is the reason I have muted all notifications</p>

<p>Twitter is a medium for me to share my thoughts. Most of them will be shit. Some might be useful to you</p>

<p>Also, I tweet a lot</p>

<p>So depending on noise vs signal, take a call! Thanks</p>
