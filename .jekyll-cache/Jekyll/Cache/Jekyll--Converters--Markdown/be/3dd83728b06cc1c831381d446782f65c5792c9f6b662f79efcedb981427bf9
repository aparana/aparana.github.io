I"<p>I am trying a new way of retaining what I read: Creating graphs and 2*2 matrices</p>

<p>Here are a few couple of examples</p>

<ul>
  <li>I read about Frequency vs Coverage for transportation systems from <a href="https://goodreads.com/book/show/44451608-better-buses-better-cities">this book</a>. According to the author, the ideal transportation medium should cover both</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a 2*2 matrix I drew for the area I live in</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/frequency_coverage.png" alt="Frequency vs Coverage" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>I listened to a <a href="https://player.fm/series/venture-stories/the-art-of-great-management-with-alex-maccaw">podcast</a> recently where the author spoke about an interesting thing about hiring</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/hiring_alex.png" alt="Alex's Hiring Insights" /></p>

<p>He said Most founders think they are doing C and D, while the reality is A and B</p>

<ul>
  <li>Premium vs Economy</li>
</ul>

<p>This is something I have been thinking a lot. How do you make sure the ticket size increases for a high frequency but low ticket size business like ride hailing?</p>

<p>It is by making people move to a Premium category</p>

<p>How do you create a Premium category?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/premium_category.png" alt="Premium Category" /></p>

<p>Now that I think more on this, maybe Average Car quality and Good Drivers can become a Budget category</p>
