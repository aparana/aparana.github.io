I""<p>I have been sharing my goals publicly for quite some time now</p>

<p>Some people feel that sharing your goals lead to a feeling of accomplishment and you drop the ball on them. I have had the opposite experience. Holding myself accountable publicly has always helped me stay focused and achieve my goals. Keeping that in mind I shared my personal OKRs on Twitter during the beginning of the year. The tweet got quite popular and a lot of people shared their OKRs with me and kept updating their own progress over time, example <a href="https://twitter.com/NirantK/status/1189882367860707331">this one by Nirant around Finance</a></p>

<p>Without further ado, here are the Objectives I set for myself this year and progress on each of the KRs</p>
