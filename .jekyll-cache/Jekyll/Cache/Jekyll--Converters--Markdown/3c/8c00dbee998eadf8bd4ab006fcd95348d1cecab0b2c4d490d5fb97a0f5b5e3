I"<p>â€˜Hey Manas, You are not there yet when it comes to strategy. You can get things done, but you need to develop your strategy skills.â€™ This is something I heard one of my past managers say again and again.</p>

<p>For a long time in my career, I had this reputation of someone who is a terrific execution guy - who gets shit done. As I wanted to grow into a more senior role, I decided to learn the mysterious strategic skills which were holding me back.</p>

<p>I read like a dozen books and hundreds of posts on competitive strategy. Not an exaggeration. I literally read a <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/08/27/learn-business-strategy.html">dozen books</a>.</p>

<p>Now I could draw flywheels and do 7 powers analysis in my sleep. Was it enough?</p>

<p>Nope. Because what people donâ€™t tell you is when they talk about strategy in middle management they donâ€™t actually mean strategy in a pure sense.</p>

<p>What they really want you to do is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ssdq_GLyPFsxITzRfRR6aV3JErB3_VFsBhUmOj_4H0M/edit?usp=sharing">charter document with the vision and mission for your team</a>.</li>
  <li>Know if you are on the right path while executing on your vision; know your <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ssdq_GLyPFsxITzRfRR6aV3JErB3_VFsBhUmOj_4H0M/edit?usp=sharing">north star</a></li>
  <li>Know your <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ssdq_GLyPFsxITzRfRR6aV3JErB3_VFsBhUmOj_4H0M/edit?usp=sharing">stakeholders and their objectives</a></li>
  <li>Identify the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ssdq_GLyPFsxITzRfRR6aV3JErB3_VFsBhUmOj_4H0M/edit?usp=sharing">key dimensions</a></li>
  <li>Have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FbGVvFG4bPkazM-7AJb4Ukjv7X4Ho8oZStT1lJX23sI/edit#gid=192262272">prioritized backlog</a></li>
  <li>Know the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DszNh1PTsSfYaO7o7tiIftSqaLjorrB5RQqptGlwcZ8/edit?usp=sharing">key themes</a> across which your key backlog items can be grouped</li>
  <li>Set medium-term goals; <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kc68s8PD6ImoFwzAxo3Bi3JUk58UIgewggiQ_ckx9Fw/edit?usp=sharing">plan your OKRs</a></li>
  <li>Set short term goals; <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/05/01/running-IPM.html">plan your sprints</a></li>
  <li>Create a feedback loop through regular <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/29/retrospectives.html">retrospectives</a></li>
  <li>Set up a process to collect <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/12/07/research.html">insights from Research and Busines Intelligence</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ez5NflYwy9DxhAXzg2AA2p0eMLVWg3QgxHatg3Td1zA/edit?usp=sharing">Write a pitch doc</a> for your big projects</li>

</ul>

<p>Trust me, I have never seen anyone do 7 powers analysis or draw Porterâ€™s 5 forces diagram in any of the company I have worked at.</p>

<p>Just do all the things I mentioned above. Thatâ€™s it. Now you are someone who is strategic.</p>
