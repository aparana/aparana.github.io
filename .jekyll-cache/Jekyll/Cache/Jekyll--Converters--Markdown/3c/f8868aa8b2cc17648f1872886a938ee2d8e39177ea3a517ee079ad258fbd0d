I"Å	<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I originally wrote this Twitter thread some time in May when Swiggy had paused their Super program. They have reintroduced it now. I wrote this thread mostly as a Swiggy power user and not from the POV of a PM. Hence instead of worrying about impact of the decision to pause Super on revenue, I wrote about the change in my own food ordering pattern.</p>

<p><strong>/threadstarts</strong></p>

<p>Subscription programs are a great way to increase switching cost</p>

<p>I never used to open Zomato till I had Swiggy Super</p>

<p>Now every time I think of ordering, I open both Zomato and Swiggy, and compare prices Upside-down face</p>

<p>My JTBD today was to get kung pao chicken</p>

<p>I realized if I have to pay 100 bucks (tax + delivery) on Swiggy, then I might very well see restaurants from Zomato who deliver the same item</p>

<p>As long as the rating is good, I don‚Äôt care¬†</p>

<p>This is coming from someone who loves Swiggy, both the company and the app</p>

<p>And I was one of those users who ordered &gt;5X/ week pre covid</p>

<p>Tells you how powerful their Swiggy Super was</p>

<p>With a delivery fee, you have to make those mental calculations which you never did before</p>

<p>Like do I really want to pay 100 bucks extra for this 200 cart value order?</p>

<p>Wow. It is 50%</p>

<p>Maybe I can just eat the dinner my cook has made. I never used to do these calculations before</p>

<p>This was my standard order every night -&gt;</p>

<p>If you think about it, apart from the free delivery fee, the discount was not that great. But I still ordered. Almost every night</p>

<p>Without the delivery fee, the calculation was: they add taxes/extra charges, but swiggyit coupon nullifies that. So I am paying almost the true value</p>

<p>Now I am making the decision based on how much extra charge (with delivery fee) is fair</p>

<p>Is it 50%? Is it 30%? Who knows</p>

<p>I am sure a lot of users are churning at the cart page</p>

<p>Maybe they could still have run Swiggy Super but removed the discounts</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt have data based on what the decision was made. But I wonder how many orders they are losing out because users don‚Äôt want to pay extra for delivery fee when they had already paid for Swiggy Super</p>
