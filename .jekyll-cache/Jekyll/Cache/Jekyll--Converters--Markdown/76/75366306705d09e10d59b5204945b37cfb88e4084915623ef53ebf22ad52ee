<p>Google Podcast app changes the download button icon to filled from line once download happens. The best would have been to just replace the download icon with a check one.</p>

<p>A small change. But a big design improvement in terms of giving user better feedback.</p>

<p>The funny part is that they already use check for subscribed feedback. Not sure why they did not use the same behaviour here.</p>

<p>But then again, they also changed the long press on files/episodes to select it behavior, which is an industry standard.</p>

<p>Now to delete a single file you have to press edit button at top, then select the file and then delete.</p>

<p>So taking bad design decisions seem to be a constant with their team. ü§∑‚Äç</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I wrote this post when I first saw the new redesign of Google Podcast. After playing around I realised that check is for completed episodes. So I think Google made the right call. I still stick with my point about the delete interaction though.</p>
