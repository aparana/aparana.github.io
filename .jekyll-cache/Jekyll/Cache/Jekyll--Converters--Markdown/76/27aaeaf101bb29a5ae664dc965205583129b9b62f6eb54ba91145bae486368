I"×<p><strong>If you have to do a task you donâ€™t like, couple it with a rewarding activity</strong></p>

<p>Example. I hate walking home after office. So I rewarded myself excellent <a href="https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm3">noise cancellation headphones</a> to listen to podcasts while walking. Now it is very easy for me to choose walking over ordering an Uber</p>

<p>Note: People talk about how they reward themselves post workout with their favourite food. Just want to point out the difference between my approach and that: In the post workout gym meal situation, the reward is a delayed gratification. Most humans want instant gratification. And hence I think my approach is superior</p>
