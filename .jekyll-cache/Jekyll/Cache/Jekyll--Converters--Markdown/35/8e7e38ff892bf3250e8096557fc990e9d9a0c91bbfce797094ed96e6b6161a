I"õ<p>Warning: This post is image heavy</p>

<p>I try to avoid writing generic productivity pieces which are just rehashes of already available blog posts. I wrote this because a lot of people question the idea of setting reading goals (this it is too egoistic) and wonder if anyone can really manage to read and retain so much.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-read-55-books-per-year-manas-j-saloi/">A blogpost on reading habits and how to improve your reading speed </a>is something I already did. I also explained in another <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/11-habits-changed-my-life-yours-too-manas-j-saloi/">post about zero days and how to avoid them</a>.</p>

<p>This expands on the previous posts and details out my own learning workflow which has helped me read 80+ books, 1000s of blogposts, 100s of podcasts this year and also (hopefully) retain a lot of them. Letâ€™s start.</p>

<p>My primary reading device is my phone.</p>

<p>I take notes from the books I read on an <a href="https://inkpadnotepad.appspot.com/">Android app called Inkpad</a>. I have shared more details about that in the reading habits post which I shared in the beginning of this post. I copy paste the interesting paragraphs and also add my own interpretations for most non-fiction books I read.</p>

<p>At home, generally I am on my kindle. I like reading light books on on Kindle as the note taking workflow is a pain and even if all the highlights go to a Clippings page, I have a hard time separating the notes for different books and managing them later.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2250/0*A01gk4sFFIglxmth" alt="" /></p>

<p>Notes from my Kindle are centralised in the default Clipping page.</p>

<p>If the book is really heavy with tons of frameworks, ideas and I feel I have to copy paste a lot of content, then I prefer reading on my Mac using the default Books app or on my iPad.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*oLv9gRjWa-9FX4Zb" alt="" /></p>

<p>Notes from both are synced on the default Notes app provided by Apple.</p>

<p>If there are a lot of images/charts in the book then I prefer creating a Google doc and dumping it there as I did for Blue Ocean Strategy (image below).</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4464/0*crIie5GXQVDI266S" alt="" /></p>

<p>I rarely read physical books. But if I do, I highlight the important points and take photos of important excerpts on my phone.</p>

<p>The homepage of my Inkpad app not only reflects notes taken from books but also ideas from various podcasts, articles and conversations I have with my friends.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*TyqrdrcsmGDr5pPF" alt="" /></p>

<p>I am a big podcast nut. During commute, lunch, and while waiting for people I prefer connecting my headphones and listen to the latest one out.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of <a href="https://castbox.fm/">Castbox app</a>, which I use.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*uXP3Yt-hbn9u3P-H" alt="" /></p>

<p>I end up taking notes for podcasts too. Here is one on how to think about your career from Marc Andreessen.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*jm7v3zN4oReNGATK" alt="" /></p>

<p>This wraps up books and podcasts. Now off to articles. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-should-i-read-manas-j-saloi/">I have already written a separate post on the blogs, newsletters I read regularly.</a> I end up bookmarking the ones I like and saving them in specific folders I have created. If I want to read something later, and donâ€™t have time now, I save them on a folder called â€˜To watchâ€™. I spend my weekends going through it.</p>

<p>This ends the first section of the post which covered how/where I read and also the process of taking notes. How to retain though? I have always found that the best way to retain something is by discussing it with your friends, adding your own thoughts and also periodically rereading the book summary/ notes.</p>

<p>A sample post on monetisation for vernacular apps came out of a late night discussion with a friend who is super bullish on this sector.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*-qkitjn1ouIkTQs_" alt="" /></p>

<p>I keep writing notes on various things which occupy my headspace and sharing then tweet storming. A lot of people comment/reply with their own views and it helps me have a more holistic idea about the topic. Most of my blogposts come out from Twitter threads, such as the one on hyperlocal startups and the future of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thoughts-dunzo-swiggy-manas-j-saloi/">Swiggy and Dunzo</a></p>

<p>Most of the notes never get published, but help me understand why something might be happening.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*OF4I6DMz75TB-iAR" alt="" /></p>

<p>Finally I try to create frameworks which can be applied in my career as well as personal life. This is my PM handbook with dozens of frameworks on Product management.</p>

<p>I also study models created by others, play around with them, and see if I can improve them.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4242/0*qfbto9vFZXVwiMTW" alt="" /></p>

<p>Apart from these, I have docs on almost everything under the sun. Below is a Doc on interview preparation. I created that so that I never have to spend more than a week preparing for interviews if I ever want a new job. It is 100+ pages long.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4464/0*nhNnIi1z5gN4-8vv" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4464/0*_2P3RwXsXSboGq1F" alt="" /></p>

<p>Above is a doc with a 30 day on-boarding plan to help me get me started on a new PM role.</p>

<p>Finally the best way to learn is to share more. I try publishing my weekend reads blog every Saturday. Consistency is the key here. Because I share a newsletter every week, I am always reading whenever I get time.</p>

<p>Hope this was useful. Happy reading.</p>

<p>And learning.</p>
