I"R<p>A common complaint I get from people when they see my <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/23/running-product-team.html">docs and processes at work</a> is that they seem excessive for a startup. “Documents are for big companies”, they say. Or they think my boss is a dictator who forces me to write a 50-page spec document.</p>
