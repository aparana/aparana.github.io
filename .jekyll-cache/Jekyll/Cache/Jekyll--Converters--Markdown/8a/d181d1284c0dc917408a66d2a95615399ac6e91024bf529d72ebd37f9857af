I"“<p>I had written the original <a href="https://twitter.com/manas_saloi">thread</a> a few months back. I generally save some of my longer threads to turn them into blogposts later. Somehow forgot to do it for this thread and later people started asking me for the thread later on DM (because my tweets delete in X weeks). Thankfully <a href="https://twitter.com/trailsofinju">Gowtham, a friend</a> had taken screenshots of the thread and saved them for later use. This post is constructed turning by those screenshots into text thanks to this <a href="https://www.onlineocr.net/">Online OCR site</a> because I am too lazy to write the whole thing again :)</p>
