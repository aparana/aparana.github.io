I"1<p>More than a decade ago I was looking for advice on whether to choose Computer Science at BITS Goa for my undergrad studies (which I was got through in the first iteration itself) or take up Chemical Engineering in the Pilani campus, and hope that I get a better branch over the next few iterations</p>
