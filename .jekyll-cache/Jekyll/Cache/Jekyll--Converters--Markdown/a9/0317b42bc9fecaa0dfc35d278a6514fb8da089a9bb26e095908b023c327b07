I"@<p>I have spent a year now working with PMs in my team on their career dev plans. I have seen our 1-1s evolve. We have done endless gap analysis and discussed growth plans. I have also mentored a few other PMs in Gojek. Since I have enjoyed the experience so far I have decided to mentor a small group of early PMs.</p>
