I"<p>I keep getting Twitter DMs like these regularly</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/request_product_spec.png" alt="Product Spec request" /></p>

<p>So I decided to spend my afternoon today writing a Product spec for Emoji reactions to Twitter messages (which launched a couple of days back)</p>

<h2 id="you-can-find-the-link-here-emoji-reactions-on-twitter-messages">You can find the link here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sUX-sm5qZ474PCQQUpvdi3lvvmWPluqHOyfXz3xKL2M/edit">Emoji Reactions on Twitter Messages</a></h2>

<p>Feel free to use this template</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This is just a product spec. It does not include user flows</li>
  <li>I am thinking of writing a separate doc with wireframes (on how I would do the reactions feature)</li>
  <li>Will also write a separate doc on how to prioritise between features</li>
  <li>My goal is to start from planning OKRs and come down to individual product specs :)</li>
</ul>
