I"Ü<p>A few tips to get your time back:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/23/running-product-team.html">Collaborate async through documentation</a>.</li>
  <li>End meetings early if you are done discussing the agenda items. Tell people I am giving back your X mins, which always make attendees happy.</li>
  <li>Send an agenda with the meeting invite. Agenda less meetings lead to people digressing and talking random things, without coming to a decision on the open item for which the meeting was called.</li>
  <li>30 min meetings by default.</li>
  <li>For any meeting the following should be clear: Host who leads the meeting, Decider for the open items, agenda items.</li>
  <li>If the decider is not there, donâ€™t call a meeting and waste time.</li>
  <li>If you have a weekly recurring meeting, you can still cancel it if there are no open items to discuss.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t call/attend meetings because there is a calendar invite.</li>
  <li>Remember, most meetings can be an email. And most emails can be a slack message.</li>
  <li>Be protective of your calendar. Decline meetings where you think you donâ€™t have anything to contribute.</li>
  <li>If the entire meeting is supposed to be a discussion around a doc, you can just circulate the doc and ask for comments async.</li>
  <li>For me, meetings are an escalation, when all written communication fail.</li>
  <li>Put slots on your calendar when you want to get work done without any distraction. Cancel all meeting invites, unless important, if they clash.</li>
  <li>Keep my Mondays relatively open. Plan for the week so that you have a proactive week than a reactive one.</li>
  <li>Put most 1-1s on a single day. It is Thursday for me. Rest of the days feel free to do deep work.</li>
