I"<ul>
  <li>Define DRI/DARCI, milestones and project scopes clearly but anticipate changes along the way.</li>
  <li>Make sure ownership of the project is clear from day 1.</li>
  <li>Define roll out strategy early in the project.</li>
  <li>Plan ahead for hand/take over of the project.</li>
  <li>Communicate actively via all mediums (i.e. Slack, Email, documentations etc).</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Communicate better with visual aids if possible.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Centralise your documentation and use it actively.</li>
  <li>Loop in PMs, TLs from dependent teams early instead of sending FYI mails at the last minute</li>
  <li>If you have got commitment from them, then send out a mail with
    <ul>
      <li>Owner for each task</li>
      <li>Timeline</li>
      <li>Status</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Frequently send out updates, highlighting dependencies, so that these are resolved before codefreeze</li>
  <li>Sending out a mail or slack does not mean commitment from the other team. Make sure the commitments are acknowledged on mail/slack</li>
  <li>Link to the relevant discussions you have had with external stakeholders in your update mails/slack comments. Also add these to your MOM section in the spec</li>
  <li>A taskâ€™s status should be one of these:
    <ul>
      <li>Yet to be picked</li>
      <li>In progress</li>
      <li>Done</li>
      <li>Delayed</li>
      <li>At-Risk</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Involve key stakeholders and ensure they are held responsible.</li>
  <li>Avoid last-minute surprises. If you hate last-minute bad news as a manager, then avoid giving the same to your manager too.</li>
  <li>Keep giving frequent updates so that blockers are highlighted much before they delay your project.</li>
  <li>Escalate blockers early. Also share good news early, if any, to motivate the team.</li>
  <li>In case a project fails, make sure you highlight both the good and the bad. Most people focus only on the bad. Write a post-mortem report with learnings, and share the next steps.</li>
</ul>
