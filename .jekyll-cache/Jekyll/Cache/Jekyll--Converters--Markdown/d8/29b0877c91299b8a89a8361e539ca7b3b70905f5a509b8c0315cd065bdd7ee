I"…<p>As a Product Manager the first thing you should do every morning is look at yesterdayâ€™s data. Most of the times there wonâ€™t be any dramatic change in your metrics. But if you wake up one fine morning to find a 20% drop in any of your KPIs, you should know why. You wonâ€™t appreciate your CEO sending you a Stinker mail ccâ€™ing half of the company, do you?</p>

<p>In this post I will teach you how to do a <strong>RCA</strong> (Root cause analysis). We used to track a lot of KPIs at Craftsvilla, but our north start metric was <strong>Conversion</strong> (Transactions/DAU)</p>

<p>Say conversation hovered around X and due to some reason it dropped by 20% the day before. I would notice the drop in my daily morning metrics email and use the following process to figure out what went wrong:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First thing to check â€” <strong>If there was any seasonal effect</strong>. For most B2C businesses usage peaks during weekend as majority users are at home. While for B2B SaaS companies there is a drop as employees are not at work. It is stupid to compare Sundayâ€™s data with Monday and feel bad if there was a drop in conversion. Or comparing numbers during Diwali week with the week after.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In absence of any seasonal effect the next step is to check <strong>if anything went wrong at our end.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Was there any server downtime?
Were the API response times same as usual? For this I would look at New Relic data and cross check with my Dev Lead.
Did any new build go out yesterday?
I would open Crashlytics to see crash rate and if there was any spike in it</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What does yesterdayâ€™s hourly data say</strong>? Checking this report is always the easiest way to confirm if something broke.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example: Between 2PM to 5PM there were no transactions recorded. It means something happened during that period which let to overall conversion drop.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I am convinced there was no seasonal effect as well as tech I would <strong>check the conversion funnel next.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For a typical e-com company the funnel looks something like this:
Home -&gt; Category Page -&gt; Product Detail Page -&gt; Cart -&gt; Success Page</p>

<p>Was there any significant drop in any part of the funnel?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Next step is to <strong>check performance of all traffic sources and user segments</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mobile vs Desktop
New Users vs Old Users
Organic vs Paid
Did our SEO rank drop?
What about yesterdayâ€™s push notification? Did they go out on time. How did it perform compared to our historical push data
Perform same exercise for email campaigns</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How many new users transacted on the app yesterday?</strong> There is a chance of some acquisition campaign performing poorly too. I would check the performance of each marketing campaign and if any particular one out of them led to the drop. Any mobile attribution platform like Tune/ Apsalar/Appsflyer gives you this data</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly I would <strong>look at all customer engagement channels</strong>. Check Support tickets, Play Store reviews, Customer chat logs to see if the volume of complaints increased</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After doing all these steps there is a high chance I would find the root cause of the drop and fixed it</p>

<p>In case you are not doing this exercise at your company here are some action items:</p>

<p>A) Get <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic up</a> and running. Also set up Server logs to catch errors
B) Have something like Pingdom to alert you of downtime instantly
C) Track funnels on <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a>
D) Track performance of Push notifications and Emails
E) Schedule daily metrics report along with hourly data
F) If you find any bug, ping your Developers on <a href="https://flock.com">Flock</a> and report it!</p>

<p>Having data is not enough though. Make it a practice to look at data daily. Set half an hour in your daily schedule just to look at data</p>
