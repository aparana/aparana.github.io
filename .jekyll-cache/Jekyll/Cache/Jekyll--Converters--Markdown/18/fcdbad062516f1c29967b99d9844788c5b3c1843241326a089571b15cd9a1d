<p>Terminology</p>
<ul>
  <li>PDG = Product Dev Group = In the context of this post it means the Transport PDG</li>
  <li>Stream = A smaller group inside the PDG which looks after a specific area; Currently it is Growth and Key Initiatives for me where I lead 3 PMs</li>
  <li>Sub stream = Smaller pods inside a bigger stream with its own PM and TL which looks after a specific area inside the stream</li>
  <li>Links to format/ doc templates for most of these meeting here: <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/23/running-product-team.html">Project Apollo</a></li>
  <li>You can find meaning of some of the words you might not be familiar with here: <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/23/running-product-team.html">Project Apollo</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1-1 with my own manager and my reports are sacred; rest 1-1s depends on whether there is an agenda for the week</li>
  <li>My long term goal is to spend around 1 day worth of time/week/ direct report</li>
  <li>These meetings are only the regular process meetings I attend. There are far more meetings which I organise/attend, but those are to tackle specific problems, and donâ€™t occupy a regular slot in my calendar</li>
  <li>IC PMs lead one of more sub streams in a PDG org but does not have direct PM reports</li>
</ul>
