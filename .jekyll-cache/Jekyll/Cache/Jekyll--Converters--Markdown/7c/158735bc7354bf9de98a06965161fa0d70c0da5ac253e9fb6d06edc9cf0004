<h2 id="more-learnings">More Learnings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What really matters can be different from industry to industry. For consulting, it‚Äôs the message (so what?) and the estimated impact that implication brings‚Äîconsultants arrive at this message and impact through following a series of problem-solving steps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In McKinsey‚Äôs case, it involves:
    <ul>
      <li>identifying the problem,</li>
      <li>structuring the problem (making sure all the issues are covered by using a MECE, mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, approach),</li>
      <li>prioritizing and eliminating unnecessary problems,</li>
      <li>creating the analysis and work plan,</li>
      <li>conducting the analysis,</li>
      <li>synthesizing to derive meaningful results,</li>
      <li>delivering the right communication message. In the end, the message needs to be tailored to fit the client context (capability, resource, and execution power) to lead to any tangible impact</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who rise to leadership know more deeply who they are, what they are good at, and how to improve their strengths. But there is another, more subtle difference that I want to share with you. This technique sets leaders apart from others. At McKinsey, we focus on being distinctive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It‚Äôs not realistic to try to convey much meaningful information in a very short period of time. That‚Äôs why you need to learn certain rules. The first rule is to understand the theory of ‚Äúdouble-clicking.‚Äù It‚Äôs similar to when you read a comment or blurb of a certain product on an e-commerce site or a short summary snippet of a bestselling book. These tell you enough to get you interested but not nearly enough for you to know what‚Äôs happening. So you end up clicking the link to find out more. In the same way, a 30-second answer gives your listener the opportunity to keep refocusing the attention to the topic of his or her interest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúThe first day of any project needs to be as exhausting as the final day of the progress review,‚Äù You need to shine in the first week because that is when most of the impression about you will be decided by all of your stakeholders‚Äîyour team, client, and senior leaders. Therefore, it is imperative that you bring in as much as you physically and mentally can during this period.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to present a case with the ending already factored in. People would rather skip over multiple scenes to finish the movie, and they‚Äôd definitely want to grasp the sense of how things will turn out for a business presentation. People don‚Äôt like to wait. That is why you should learn to create an end output image all the time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The higher up you go in the professional hierarchy, the better people are at hiding emotions underneath their smiles. It‚Äôs an extraordinary skill, and few have recognized it as something extremely useful as a leader.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Every time at work someone gives you something outrageous to do, wait for 24 hours before you act upon it with a counteroffer. There are two basic underpinnings for this rule:
    <ol>
      <li>People (and usually senior leaders) have the best interests of you and the company at heart.</li>
      <li>You will tend to regret any negative or rebuking answers you make when you are under emotional siege.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Using shorter sentences can also present you as a more mature leader.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Talking to someone using fewer words takes practice. It is a lot more difficult than it looks at first because it requires you to order and structure your story clearly, eliminate or omit certain details selectively, choose the right words carefully, and answer potential questions as much as possible in your description.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By concentrating on convincing people faster and with fewer words, you are building a unique skill. It‚Äôs like you are becoming the expert anchorman of a well-scripted TV news program. Aim for 30 minutes first and then try saying the same message in half that time (but not through learning to talk faster). Purposely set a time and weigh that against the amount of content delivered. At the same time, see the level of excitement you have generated.</p>
