I".<p>I was obsessed with Zynga Poker when I was in college. Every morning I would wake up excited, and then wait to receive the Zynga Poker briefcase, which would let me unlock more virtual coins. After years of playing offline (not regularly), I spent 6 months last year learning the game. I must have spent most of my waking minute, apart from work, on adda52</p>

<p><strong>Here is my guide on how to become a better Poker player</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Start with understanding the math behind Poker. Mandatory read: <a href="https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2017/05/14/essential-poker-math-hardin.html">Essential Poker Math - Alton Hardin</a>. Can’t stress how important it is to start with the fundamentals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn more poker theory, especially <a href="https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2017/05/16/theory-poker-sklansky.html">the fundamental theory of Poker from David Sklansky</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proceed to learn how to play various Poker styles. Here is how you play a TAG game like Helmuth: <a href="https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2017/05/13/play-poker-like-pros-hellmuth.html">Play Poker Like the Pros - Phil Hellmuth</a>, another on Doyle Brunson’s style of play: <a href="https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2017/05/15/super-system-doyle.html">Doyle Brunson’s Super System</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are countless other books on: tournament play, cash games, micro stakes, high stakes. I read a bunch of these but ended up completing none when I realized that most of these were written way back, and are no longer relevant for the current tournament scene</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are 2 different schools of Poker: One is Game Theory Optimal, while the other is Exploitative Strategy. One relies on Game Theory while the other is around exploiting opponents. The best players play a mixed strategy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete these masterclasses: <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/08/25/daniel-negreanu-masterclass.html">Daniel Negreanu Teaches Poker</a> &amp; <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/08/24/phil-ivey-masterclass.html">Phil Ivey Teaches Poker Strategy</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The masterclass by Negreanu is really good, and my fortunes on the Poker table changed thanks to incorporating his insights in my tournament play. I highly recommend it. Ivey’s is a little more advanced and something I would recommend once you master the basics</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the main aspects of playing Poker is mastering the mental side: Avoiding tilt, learning from your mistakes, realizing that the Gita teaching “karm kar without focussing on results” is true both in Poker and in life. For this, I recommend reading: <a href="https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2017/05/11/mental-game-poker-jared-tendler.html">The Mental Game of Poker - Barry Carter, Jared Tendler</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bad beats will happen. That is part of the game. But you can’t change your strategy based on how the last hands went. AA shove might run into a J2 flush and lose out. Does not mean that it was a bad play. Believe in the math. Believe in your own strategy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are a beginner you need to track your performances and see how you are faring. Here are 3 sheets I maintained</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pl_2.png" alt="Cash strategy" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pl_3.png" alt="Tournament details" /></p>

<p>Once I improved, I did stop measuring at this level. But this is something you need to do for the first few months for sure
Image</p>

<ul>
  <li>After each bad beat, each hand where I learned something new, I added to this note</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pl_5.png" alt="Poker learnings" /></p>

<p>I learn everything the same way. Doing. Measuring. Iterating.</p>

<p>Also making tons of mistakes :)</p>

<ul>
  <li>I also had a note with how I went out in all the tournaments I played so that I don’t keep making the same mistakes</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pl_4.png" alt="Tournament exits" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Take loads of notes. Taking notes, and learning through a tight feedback loop is how I learn most things. You can see notes taken from various books, as well as blogs I read on Poker below</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pl_6.png" alt="Learnings 6" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pl_7.png" alt="Learnings 7" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pl_8.png" alt="Learnings 8" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pl_9.png" alt="Learnings 9" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pl_10.png" alt="Learnings 10" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Apart from things mentioned above, I also watched 100s of hours of Twitch streams, 100s of hours of Youtube videos of tournament play, as I had decided to focus more on Tournaments instead of Cash games. The entire recommended section on my Youtube Home was Poker videos</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is all about putting in the hours. For these 6 months, Poker had become like a 2nd full-time job. I spent 6-10 hours every day on Poker. It was all I did after coming back from Office, as well as during weekends when I had more free time</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It requires a lot of effort to be good at something</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finally, you have to be willing to make sacrifices. Thankfully my amazing girl friend supported me, was okay with me spending so many hours on it, and even consoled me when I had bad beats</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope this was useful</p>
