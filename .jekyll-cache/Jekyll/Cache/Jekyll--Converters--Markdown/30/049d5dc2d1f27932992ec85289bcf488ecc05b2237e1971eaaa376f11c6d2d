I"l<p>I was obsessed with Zynga Poker when I was in college. Every morning I would wake up excited, and then wait to receive the Zynga Poker briefcase, which would let me unlock more virtual coins. After years of playing offline (not regularly), I spent 6 months last year learning the game. I must have spent most of my waking minute, apart from work, on adda52</p>
