I"N<p>We like involving Design as early as we can in the product development process. As soon as the first draft of the spec is done, We get Design and Dev involved through a Kick off meeting which explains the problem statement we are tackling, the WHY behind a feature. After the WHY is explained, we start brainstorming on Design</p>
