I"m<p>I have read close to 600 books, at least according to Goodreads. My average rating is around 4.27. People give me a lot of shit about my high ratings. They think I rate every book 5 stars. That is maybe an exaggeration. But I do generally rate things high. It is not just books, I do the same with restaurants, service workers, and even movies on IMBD  </p>
