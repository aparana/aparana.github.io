I"¢<p>I recently tweeted about learning as a PM and how to use the BUILD - MEASURE - LEARN loop for your own development</p>

<p><strong>/threadstarts</strong></p>

<p>I became a PM 1 year out of college. From being a junior dev who did not have the access to deploy to Prod and had to rely on his TL for small issues, I transitioned to someone who could tell people with 10 years work experience how to ‚Äúbuild products‚Äù.</p>

<p>The PM role is a delicate mix of Individual Contributor work and leading a team. To become good at my job and not screw up I started creating a bunch of lists and frameworks.</p>

<p><strong>The general feedback loop for a PM:</strong></p>

<p>Do stuff -&gt; Measure the impact -&gt; Learn -&gt; Incorporate learnings into your processes -&gt; Do more stuff.</p>

<p>Below are the lists I created for incorporating the above loop in my job.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DECISIONS LIST</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Major decisions</p>

<ul>
  <li>I</li>
  <li>My company management made</li>
</ul>

<p>Since Day 1, I wanted to understand thoughts that go into making a decision. How to people arrive at big decisions? What parameters they use to evaluate? Do people follow up on a decision and revisit them later?</p>

<p>For every place I have worked at I have a note with important decisions taken by me/ other stakeholders.</p>

<p>When I learned something from the decisions/my follow up action items I would add them to my other lists (which I have mentioned below).</p>

<p>My hiring manager had told me once - Don‚Äôt learn from just your own mistakes/ successes. Have a bird eye view of the organisation. See how the CEO/ management/ senior managers make decisions. Learn from them.</p>

<p>Okay, that manager is @madhurchadha.</p>

<p>Lets move on to the other lists.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SHAME LIST</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All the screw ups I made as a PM/ employee.</p>

<p>This is the Shame List from my CouponDunia days. The number of fuckups and misses run pages. Years later I still cringe at how bad I was at my job. But I learned from my mistakes and improved as a PM over years.</p>

<p>Now think of such a list for every place I have worked at.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>LEARNINGS LIST</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I turn my shame into learnings.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>FEEDBACK LIST</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>List of feedbacks I have got during my 1-1s as well as performance evaluation sessions.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/feedback_list.png" alt="Feedback list" /></p>

<p>This is one example of feedback I got from a developer during our 1-1. I learned that instead of focussing more on the product I was doing release/project management. Instead of focusing on the bigger picture I was getting to much into technical implementations.</p>

<p>1-1s can be a valuable source for feedback. Don‚Äôt be scared of asking for feedback. Be vulnerable. Look for 1-1s, retrospectives and even performance evaluations as a source of learning.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>MANAS 2.0</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I know it is egoistic to call a list 2.0 of yourself. But it is a list of all the things I have learned + want to do in the future.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/manas2.png" alt="Manas 2.0" /></p>

<p>This is also a long list. I also had to relearn most of the lessons the hard way.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DON‚ÄôT DO</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Self explanatory. Comes from 1-1s, Performance reviews, my own self evaluation. Things I want to avoid.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/dont_do.png" alt="Don't do" /></p>

<p>I try to do weekly self evaluations and reflect on how my life (both professional and personal) is going.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>HOW TO BUILD PRODUCTS</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>A list of all the frameworks and learnings from my own experience + others (blogs/books etc).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/how_to_build_products.png" alt="How to build products" /></p>

<p>Check out my frameworks post here: <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/05/pm-frameworks.html">Product Management Principles &amp; Frameworks</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>LOOP HABIT TRACKER</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Once I identify habits I want to acquire or behaviours I want to let go off, I start tracking them on Loop Habit Tracker.</p>

<p>I open it every night before I go to sleep and evaluate my day.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/loop_tracker.png" alt="Loop habit tracker" /></p>

<p>Apart from all these, I try to read a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Why make the same mistakes others have made and written about?</strong></p>
