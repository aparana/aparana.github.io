I"F<p>I recently caught up with a junior from college (lets call him X) who had moved into Product Management a few months back</p>

<p>Within 30 mins of meeting me, he told me that even though his company was doing well: had raised a large round of funding, he was thinking of leaving because he felt his manager did not trust him, and was not putting any effort in mentoring him</p>

<p>There is this saying that <a href="https://getlighthouse.com/blog/people-leave-managers-not-companies/">People Leave Managers, not Companies</a>, and this would have been another example of that</p>

<p>Instead of judging his manager, I decided to dig deeper and find the root cause of his frustration. Soon the answer was pretty clear. The real issue was a lack of communication between X and his manager</p>

<p>Even after 4 months of joining this startup, there was a lack of alignment/clarity on</p>
<ul>
  <li>what was his manager’s expectation</li>
  <li>what was the growth path of X</li>
  <li>what was the responsibilities of X in the team</li>
  <li>what was X’s strength and his weaknesses</li>
  <li>how was X going to overcome his weaknesses and reach the next level</li>
</ul>

<p>My advice to X was simple. <strong>It was to talk to his Manager.</strong> It was clear that there was a communication gap and without more open communication there was only two possibilities</p>
<ul>
  <li>the relationship would deteriorate further and X would not be able to work at the best of his capabilities</li>
  <li>X would have to look for another job</li>
</ul>

<p>I wanted him to figure out whether the bunch of thoughts/accusations he had about his manager were even legit. Or did these thoughts come because he did not have a communication channel with his manager and hence he found it easier to fill in the gaps with his insecurities and doubts</p>

<p>Tasks I gave him:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set up an 1-1 with his manager. Set it as a recurring event</li>
  <li>Get answers for his questions. Add them to the agenda</li>
  <li>Do not miss a scheduled 1-1 under any circumstance. If missed, set up another one later</li>
  <li>Block his manager’s calendar instead of waiting on his manager to set up dedicated time for him</li>
</ul>

<p>I got this message from him a couple of days back. Needless to say the 1-1 went well</p>

<p>There are a bunch of resources on how to do an 1-1 already: <a href="https://firstround.com/review/managers-take-your-1-1s-to-the-next-level-with-these-6-must-reads/">Managers, Take Your 1:1s to the Next Level with These 6 Must Reads</a>, <a href="https://getlighthouse.com/blog/one-on-one-meetings-template-great-leaders/">One on One Meetings: The Only Guide Managers Need</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@mrabkin/awkward-1-1s-the-art-of-getting-honest-feedback-2843078b2880">Awkward 1:1s: How To Get Honest Feedback</a>, <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/">The Update, The Vent, and The Disaster</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/one-on-ones-are-my-most-valuable-meetings-heres-how-i-run-them-d9ae7c64dade">One-on-ones are my most valuable meetings; here’s how I run them</a>, <a href="https://svpg.com/coaching-tools-the-one-on-one/">The One on One</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/know-your-team-blog/the-one-on-one-meeting-template-for-your-end-of-the-year-review-735c5fb557d">The one-on-one meeting template for your end of the year review</a>, <a href="https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/05/06/making-manager-julie.html">The Making of a Manager 1-1</a>, <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-5-mistakes-youre-likely-making-in-your-one-on-one-meetings-with-direct-reports/">The 5 mistakes you’re likely making in your one-on-one</a>,<a href="https://github.com/VGraupera/1on1-questions">One on One Questions list</a>, <a href="https://jasonevanish.com/2014/05/29/101-questions-to-ask-in-1-on-1s/">101 Questions to Ask in One on Ones</a>, <a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2018/01/11/the-8-best-questions-to-ask-during-a-one-on-one-meeting/">The 8 best questions to ask during a one-on-one meeting</a></p>

<p>If you have read the posts, you know by now that there is no singular way to do 1-1s. So use the time to align with your manager on</p>
<ul>
  <li>where are you now (in terms of responsibilities, impact)</li>
  <li>expectation (for the next X weeks)</li>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/@ianmcall/mind-the-gap-analysis-and-get-promoted-e4bb4462ef40">gap analysis</a></li>
  <li>help needed</li>
  <li>good and bad things since the last 1-1</li>
  <li>your performance and if there is improvement needed in anything</li>
</ul>

<p>^ Notes from my last 1-1 with my manager. As you can see the agenda items are listed at the top, first mine followed my manager. Then there are action items/feedback on topics listed on the agenda section</p>

<p>What I have found most helpful in my 1-1s with my manager</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep a dedicated doc for your 1-1s. My manager created one for us which can be editable by both</li>
  <li>Have a regular cadence. For me it is Thursday afternoon</li>
  <li>Share agenda with your manager for the 1-1: It can be anything which you want to escalate, want clarity on, your growth path, things you need help with, things you want to highlight</li>
  <li>Your manager can add to the agenda too: It will be items which are on the top of his mind, follow up items from last 1-1 etc</li>
  <li>Take notes during the 1-1 if it is a sit down meeting. Else go on a walk and then add the MOM later. I prefer walking 1-1s whenever we are both in the same location</li>
  <li>Generally 1-1s are sacred and you should not miss them</li>
  <li>1-1s are also the time for honest conversations. If you are not using them for that, you are losing out</li>
</ul>
