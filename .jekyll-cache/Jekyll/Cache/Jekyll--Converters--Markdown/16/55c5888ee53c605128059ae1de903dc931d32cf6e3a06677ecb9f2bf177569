I"^<p>I have been watching football since 2002. My dad got cable TV to watch the world cup in the summer but forgot to disconnect after that. I have been playing Fifa since FIFA 2000. One thing I never did though was learn to play football well. Do deep into the tactics as well as develop the stamina and skills to play football on a regular basis</p>
