  <li>After our meeting, I asked everyone I could about Zuckerbergâ€™s unusual appeal for feedback. Is this normal? Has he ever asked you? Following several inquiries, I had my answer: the request was simply a glimpse into the way he runs Facebook. Zuckerberg has built feedback into Facebookâ€™s very fiber. Major meetings end with requests for it. Posters around Facebookâ€™s offices say FEEDBACK IS A GIFT. And nobody in the company is above it, not even Zuckerberg himself</li>
