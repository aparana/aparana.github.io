I"<p>There are 2 ways to write a requirements document</p>

<ul>
  <li>For a product spec, I prefer focussing on the following:
    <ul>
      <li>WHY</li>
      <li>WHAT</li>
      <li>HOW right; basically the 3 elements you need for product development
It is part of the spec template I shared here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sUX-sm5qZ474PCQQUpvdi3lvvmWPluqHOyfXz3xKL2M/edit#heading=h.wtx9vk4byf">Twitter emoji spec</a>Â </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For a document on the improvement of an existing workflow/process, the focus should on
    <ul>
      <li>Outcome we want after the new workflow is set up</li>
      <li>What is the current workflow</li>
      <li>Gaps in the current workflow which are avoiding us getting the outcome we want</li>
      <li>Path to the outcome
I have not yet shared a template for this, but it something I want to do eventually!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
