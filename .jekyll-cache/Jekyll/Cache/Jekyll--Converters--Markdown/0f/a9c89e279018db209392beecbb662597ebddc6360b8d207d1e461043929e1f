I"ê<p><strong>Note:</strong> While reading a book whenever I come across something interesting, I highlight it on my Kindle. Later I turn those highlights into a blogpost. It is not a complete summary of the book. These are my notes which I intend to go back to later. I know the formatting of this post is a bit messed up. It was too much effort to edit it. So please bear for once. Let‚Äôs start!</p>
