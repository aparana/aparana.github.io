I"M<p>Whenever I try to learn a new skill, be it Poker, Fifa or Football, I create a couple of new notes on my Inkpad app</p>

<ol>
  <li>One note where I add everything I am learning about that skill by doing courses, watching Youtube lectures, watching Pros</li>
  <li>A note where I add feedback for myself each time I try out that skill</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is my note on <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/02/02/learning-football.html">learning Football which I turned into a blogpost</a></p>

<p>If you see the below images, you will see the 2 notes I created while learning Poker in 2019</p>

<ol>
  <li>First note is called Poker learnings; This includes Notes from my own learning, notes from a couple of Masterclasses I did on Poker, books I read, Twitch videos of Poker Pros</li>
  <li>Second note is called Daily poker; Every time I went out in a tournament, I would write how it happened. What decision led to my downfall and things I should avoid in the future</li>
</ol>

<p>What I was trying to do wrt Poker was separate Skill from Luck, and not base my decisions on Tournament outcomes</p>
