<p>I wrote a thread recently on why capital as a moat strategy does not work. Turning it into a blogpost (with some minor edits)</p>

<p><strong>/threadstarts</strong></p>

<p>The reason capital as a moat strategy does not work in the long run is because it lets you blitzscale without asking hard fundamental questions about your business. A few examples shared below</p>

<p><strong>Uber:</strong> Driver incentives lets you growth hack supply when you enter an underdeveloped market. As the market matures, more on demand companies enter</p>

<p>You are not competing for the same demand (Ride on Uber vs Food for Swiggy)</p>

<p>but supply suddenly has optionality
They start asking “Oh I could make X Rs. driving for Uber for an hour vs. Y Rs delivering meals for  Swiggy”</p>

<p>And they optimise for take home money/ hour</p>

<p>Suddenly you realise that <a href="https://medium.com/@gerstenzang/no-network-for-uber-175a866baaef">there was never any network effect</a></p>

<p><strong>Holachef (India’s Munchery):</strong> I remember when Holachef was the rage in Mumbai when I used to work there</p>

<p>Delicious home cooked meals delivered to your doorsteps</p>

<p>P/M fit? Yes. Who would not want delicious chole bhature for 70 bucks?</p>

<p>Sustainable business? No</p>

<p><strong>Wework:</strong> The first time I entered a Wework for some talk hosted there, I was mind blown</p>

<p>Fucking elevator music playing in bathrooms. Beer. Fruit Infused Water</p>

<p>I was like wow this place bleeds money</p>

<p>Did they really need to give out all these stuff for free?</p>

<p>Could people have managed without the unlimited beer?</p>

<p>They could have asked this much before their botched IPO.</p>

<p><a href="https://vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/31/18049142/wework-beer-wine-policy">No more tap beer</a></p>

<p>We know all about <a href="https://the-ken.com/story/perhaps-the-most-ingenious-story-of-the-indian-internet-startup-ecosystem-of-this-decade/"><strong>Droom’s growth:</strong></a>, <a href="https://nytimes.com/2020/01/13/technology/oyo-hotel-india-softbank.html"><strong>Oyo’s:</strong></a></p>

<p>Maybe they could have asked if this was the only way to grow</p>

<p>Maybe Softbank instead of pursuing growth at all costs could have taught their portfolio companies controlled sustainable growth</p>

<p>I don’t have the answers. But once the good times end, we will all start asking the same question: if Blitzscaling was the only way</p>
