I"8<p>Like Aamir Khan says in 3 Idiots, “Sab jagah gyaan bant raha ..jahan se jitna mann kare, le lo”, I believe you can find pearls of wisdom everywhere, even on Blind. All you have to do is: instead of lurking on brag posts about CTC, look for threads where people post about their experience/learnings from years of working in the valley. When there are no social media currency to earn, no reputation to protect, people are far more honest with their thoughts. This is the reason I spend most of my online hours on sites like reddit than Facebook or Twitter.</p>
