I"a<p>If you are a strategy/product person working in the on-demand sector, instead of asking what would it take for users to start taking rides/ordering food again, just ask yourself what would it take for you to do the same. I keep seeing useless ideation sessions, strategy sync-ups, but no one ever asks this simple question during these meetings.</p>
