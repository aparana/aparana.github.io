I"Y<p>One of the reasons why I will never apply for a job at Google or Facebook: Mugging up how to traverse a red black tree did not make much sense to me when I was a dev. You could just open Cormen and look it up. And it sure as hell does not make sense now, with me being a PM with more than half a decade of experience in building Products</p>
