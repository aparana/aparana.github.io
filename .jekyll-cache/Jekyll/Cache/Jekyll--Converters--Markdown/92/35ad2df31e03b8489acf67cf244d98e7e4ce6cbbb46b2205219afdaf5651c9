I"D<p>The sickest analogy I have learned recently is documentation as cache by shl. To learn more go to 13 min mark in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grXrGaT7DLw">How to Grow Your Business by Writing: Sahil Lavingia + David Perell</a></p>

<p>An application first looks for data in the cache. In case of a cache miss, it checks the database.</p>

<p>Documentation should work as a cache in your organisation. Anyone looking for information should look in the relevant documentation, and only when a cache miss happens, in this case, the info being absent in the relevant documentation, the person should go to the stakeholder.</p>

<p>Stakeholder = database. In-person meeting  = database access.</p>
