I"j	<p>Grammarly’s weekly stats mail must be one of the best email marketing content I have seen. Why?</p>

<p>1/ It starts with ‘vanity’ to drive a higher CTR. You feel like opening the mail to see why they called you a ‘legend’</p>

<p>I know Grammarly has access to everything I have been typing for the last few days. So guess they would have some genuine insights</p>

<p>2/ Once you enter they continue from the subject line. There is a strong connection between the first part of the body with the subject line</p>

<p>Gives you stats which further massages your vanity</p>

<p>3/ Starts talking about your streak. Brings gamification into the picture</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/gm_4.png" alt="Grammarly 4" /></p>

<p>This is a bit meh though! Since I have the extension, everything I type on Chrome counts towards the streak</p>

<p>Maybe the streak could have been turned into a challenge? Something more difficult to achieve</p>

<p>4/ After vanity, they come to some sentiment analysis. For a metrics junkie like me, this was super interesting. Would I want to improve on the ‘Confident’ part? Am I lacking on the ‘Encouraging’ part?</p>

<p>This is similar to PlayStore’s sentiment analysis of Reviews</p>

<p>5/ Then after making you feel good about yourself, telling you how you are faring, they finally come to the parts where you can be better</p>

<p>Some products would put this at the top. And turn this into a scare tactic for using their Product. Not Grammarly. They are your pals</p>

<p>6/ They also give you a CTA to upgrade to Grammarly Premium. But it does not come off as pushy</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/gm_7.png" alt="Grammarly 7" /></p>

<p>They also have a hook for Grammarly Business which is their B2B product. But it is at the bottom of the email</p>

<p>7/ Apps like Duolingo have become associated with aggressive tactics to boost their apps’ engagement.</p>

<p>Grammarly takes the opposite approach: Being your cheerleader</p>
