I"ž<p>I wish I had hold of something like this when I started my Product Management career. There are lot of books on the macro aspects like Strategy. And there are books on the micro like how to run an agile process. But none of them have been able to tie the macro with the micro. Or given easily customisable templates which people can use at their own companies. This Project is my humble attempt to fix that</p>
