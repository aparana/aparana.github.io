I"d<p><strong>1/ The best businesses don’t just cater to the existing market, but also lead to TAM expansion</strong></p>

<p>Zoom did not just solve video conferencing for businesses who needed it. It also allowed people to start remote first companies</p>

<p>Think about how many freelancers as well as new businesses started once they realised they did not need a physical presence and they could get into a meeting with anyone from anywhere</p>

<p>If I wanted I could just start a PM coaching business from my home</p>

<p><strong>2/ The best businesses increase category spending</strong></p>

<p>People earlier would spend 2K on a maid, 2K on groceries and, and eat out 4-5 times in a month. Spend on food was probably not more than 8-10K, if your salary was say 1L</p>

<p>After Swiggy came, people started ordering Tea when they had guests, compared to earlier when they just made the tea themselves</p>

<p>People started more money for convenience and time</p>

<p>Category spend on food went up because of on demand delivery</p>

<p>Same with Travel</p>

<p>People took roadside autos earlier. Now they spend more to get the convenience of getting the cab/auto just from their gate</p>

<p>I know people would argue about discounts, but I am sure a lot of people would continue without discounts too</p>

<p>Wrapping up, 2 characteristics of a great businesses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unlocks use cases for more people. Makes new things possible</li>
  <li>Changes behavior and  increases category spend</li>
</ul>
