I"M<p>I think there are two ways to grow in your career. The first way is to say YES a lot. YES to new projects. YES to taking more ownership. YES to long working hours. YES to doing whatever it takes to get shit done.</p>

<p>If you are early in your career, saying YES is key to your growth.</p>

<p>But most people never learn the other way of career growth, which is even more critical: Saying NO; How to say it, and When to say it. How do you block low priority projects, which wonâ€™t impact your metrics, without pissing off some key stakeholder? How to say NO to your manager when there is a need for it?</p>

<p>Also how do you disagree and commit, which is essentially a hybrid of both YES and NO.</p>

<p>Stakeholder management is all about saying YES and NO. How to say it at the right time, in the right setting, without ruining relationships.</p>

<p>If you keep hearing that someone is strategic, it probably means that they have mastered the art of saying YES and NO.</p>
