I"®<p>Thanks to social media, it has become common for people to bring their whole personality online; not just work. I love how people like <a href="https://twitter.com/levie">Aaron Levie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath">Chamath Palihapitiya</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk">Hunter Walk</a> joke, post memes here. IMHO it makes them more relatable</p>
