I"N<p>Since I am always public about my goals, here is a new one: I will try to limit my time on Twitter to just posting links, maybe apart from the occasional joke or two, if I really canâ€™t resist. I had been cutting my time on Twitter over the last few weeks by:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Turning off notifications. No idea who is quote tweeting me or liking my tweets.</li>
  <li>Turning off DMs. Not replying to incoming DMs except from people I know really well.</li>
  <li>Using motion on Desktop web.</li>
  <li>Deleting tweets every 2 days.</li>
  <li>Not replying to most comments.</li>
</ol>
