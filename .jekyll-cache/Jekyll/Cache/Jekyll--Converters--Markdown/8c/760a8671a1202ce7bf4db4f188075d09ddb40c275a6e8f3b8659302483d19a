<p>I wrote a thread recently on why I turn down most catch up requests. Turning it into a blogpost (with some minor edits)</p>

<p><strong>/threadstarts</strong></p>

<p>Till I was in my mid 20s I used to meet people just because they were from college or we had worked together somewhere</p>

<p>These were what people call ‚Äòsocial commitments‚Äô</p>

<p>I used to go to parties I did not want because I was scared people would call me a spoilsport otherwise</p>

<p>As I moved towards my late 20s, I realised how transient most relationships are</p>

<p>You barely talk to/meet ¬†people you once thought of as ‚Äúclose friends‚Äù</p>

<p>Once you move jobs, cities very few of these people will remain with you</p>

<p>So I started asking myself</p>

<p>‚ÄòIf I don‚Äôt go this party how much will this person care or even I will care later</p>

<p>The answer generally is Not much</p>

<p>‚ÄòWill I want to meet the person I am meeting today after 5 years too?‚Äô</p>

<p>Again the answer is mostly No</p>

<p>So I stopped bothering with these ‚Äòsocial commitments‚Äô</p>

<p>Now I only meet people I really want to meet</p>

<p>These are the people who I meet and then feel more optimistic and happy about myself</p>

<p>People for whom I set an alarm call in the morning saying ‚ÄúIMP Meet X in the evening‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Another filter:</strong> If there was no alcohol involved would I still meet this person?</p>

<p>Is this catch-up happening only because both of us have nothing else to do and hence we are ok spending 3 hours asking ‚Äúaur batao‚Äù over beer while waiting for the evening to get over?</p>

<p>Or is it because I am really looking forward to meet this person and hence ¬†am prioritising this person over dozen other things I could do?</p>

<p>I have very few regrets about not meeting people</p>

<p>But I have loads about</p>

<p>Going to parties I did not want but went because the person asked a dozen times and I just could not say No</p>

<p>Meeting someone knowing we will just bitch and take each others case</p>

<p>And I will just fake smile through the whole thing waiting to come back home</p>

<p>Saying No has become second nature now</p>

<p>Thanks to good defaults:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reading (books/articles)</li>
  <li>Spending time with my gf</li>
  <li>Occasional travel</li>
  <li>Learning one new thing or the other,</li>
</ol>

<p>the cost of saying Yes is much more than me sticking to my defaults</p>

<p>This is not a meta thread I wrote so that I can forward it to someone while I say No to their invitation :)</p>

<p>It took me a lot of time to learn this</p>

<p>I wish I was better at saying No when I was in college</p>

<p>And saying No is one topic I talk about often in my tweets/posts</p>
