I"‚<p>I am a firm believer in using <a href="https://www.fs.blog/mental-models/">frameworks</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d">mental models</a> to make my day to day decisions. If you are from a consulting background this might be second nature to you, but for others like me it takes time incorporating them into our lives.</p>
