I"Œ<p><strong>This blogpost is not an exhaustive summary of the book. Just contains the notes I took</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Keenly observe things around you. Use all your senses and not just smell</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always focus on the context when it comes to non verbal cues</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are two types of cues: <em>universal non verbal cues</em> and <em>idiosyncratic ones which are unique to an individual</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Observe and set baseline behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn to differentiate between comfort and discomfort behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neck touching and/or stroking is one of the most significant and frequent pacifying behaviors we use in responding to stress. Women specifically touch their neck, play with hair. Men adjust tie, shirt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Note what part of the body a person pacifies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Freeze, flight or fight are default responses in case of stress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concentrate on feet and leg first. And face at last. â€˜Happy feetâ€™ shows elation. See where the feet points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A knee clasp with person bent forward means she wants to leave. Toe pointing upward is a positive cue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Feet close to each other is submissive behavior. Legs spread apart is controlling, aggressive. Crossed legs mean comfort.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mirroring is a comfort trait.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>See if someone is trying to create barrier. One sitting position might put the knee in front making it seem like a blocker for physical contact. This generally means lack of trust/comfort.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Foot lock is a freeze behavior. If this is accompanied by a pacifying behavior then take notice.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
