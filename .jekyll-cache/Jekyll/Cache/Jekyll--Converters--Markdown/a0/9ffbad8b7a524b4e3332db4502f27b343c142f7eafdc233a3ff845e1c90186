I"ï<p>Before Gojek, I had only worked at smaller companies where everyone kept their calendars open, and you never had to fight to get a slot for a meeting. My most common question, to my manager during my first month here, used to be: ‚ÄúBut that person is always busy. How do I set up a meeting to close this? And if I get an open slot somehow, the other folks seem to have their calendars blocked.‚Äù</p>
