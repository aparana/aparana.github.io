I"•<p>I am currently on a career break. It is similar to a sabbatical where people take some time off from their jobs to do something totally different, only in my case I had to quit my job to take this. I am planning to write a separate blog post on my thoughts behind this decision. On this one I will take your through the start-up ecosystem of North-East and how the various e-com players fare here.</p>
