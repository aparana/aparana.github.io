I"^<p>I am the kind of person who likes sitting in a corner, being to myself. At work, I would probably be reading something or completing some documents. I don’t chit chat much. But that led to people inferring that I don’t like my team. My manager during a 1-1 also said that people get scared to approach me thinking I like to be left alone.</p>
