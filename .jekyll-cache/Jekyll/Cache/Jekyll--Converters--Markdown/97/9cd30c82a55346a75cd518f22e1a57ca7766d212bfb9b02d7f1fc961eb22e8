I"ƒ<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I originally wrote this Twitter thread some time in May when Swiggy had paused their Super program. They have reintroduced it now. I wrote this thread mostly as a Swiggy power user and not from the POV of a PM. Hence instead of worrying about impact of the decision to pause Super on revenue, I wrote about the change in my own food ordering pattern.</p>
