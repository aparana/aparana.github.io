I"Ä<p>Notes from <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vb2ZmdGhlY2hhaW4&amp;episode=ZjVkZjg4N2EtNTE5OS0xMWVhLTlmMjctZWY4ODdlNzVmMDYy&amp;ved=0CBoQzsICahcKEwiQ5OGRnKHoAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBQ&amp;hl=en-IN">Pomp‚Äôs interview of Brian Norgard</a>. This is one of the best podcasts I have listened to in recent times</p>

<ul>
  <li>People want cheat codes</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt make your users think</li>
  <li>The most successful consumer products are dead simple to use. They put users in a state of ‚Äúno-mind‚Äù</li>
  <li>People want to turn off their brains. Hence television worked so much. Don‚Äôt make users think too much</li>
  <li>Simplify your products</li>
  <li>Give users super power (super like vs like). All superpowers should give a positive experience and have great branding</li>
  <li>People only think of branding of products. They should also think of branding of features
    <ul>
      <li>Super like: you really like someone</li>
      <li>Boost: reach more people</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Instead of introducing paywalls, observe existing behavior, extend them, and charge for them</li>
  <li>Let people get to the meat of the application by paying for a cheat code</li>
  <li>Tinder is a video game of variable rewards. Buying Tinder gold is akin to getting cheat code in a game. It allows users to see who already liked them, thereby letting them get to the meat of the product quickly</li>
  <li>When building consumer products you should try to incorporate gaming industry ideas/insights</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt teach users how to use your product. Brian does not believe in on boarding. Users should be able to educate themselves</li>
  <li>Match your product with the correct attention span of the user</li>
  <li>All physical technologies follows a similar trend: over time, its size goes from big to medium, from medium to small, and from small to invisible</li>
  <li>People love podcasts because of multimodal consumption ‚Äî you can listen while driving, running, walking to work, etc</li>
</ul>
