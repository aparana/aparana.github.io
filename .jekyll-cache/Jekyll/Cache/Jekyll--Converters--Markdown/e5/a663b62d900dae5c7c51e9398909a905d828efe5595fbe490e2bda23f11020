<ul>
  <li>This product critique format is not for interviews. I generally spend an hour playing around with the app and go far deeper. you wonâ€™t be given more than 20 mins in an interview to do a product critique.</li>
  <li>Julie Zhuo wrote a nice post on how to do a product critique. <a href="https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/how-to-do-a-product-critique-98b657050638">Check it out</a>.</li>
  <li>I donâ€™t follow any structure, but I try to cover a few things which I will mention below.</li>
  <li>I do this critique from a PM POV. So it is not just about how the interface looks or the micro-interactions. I also spend a lot of time thinking about distribution strategies, positioning, copy, metrics, and a bunch of other things.</li>
  <li>I generally try to go out of my comfort zone and choose an app I am not familiar with to do a critique. It helps me look at it from a fresh perspective.</li>
