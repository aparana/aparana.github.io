I"]<p>I realized how fragile my life is when covid happened.Â Redundancies are costly but only during times like covid, we realize the need to have multiple backup options. Since lockdown got lifted, I have started working on how to add more resilience to my life and not have everything collapse around me if another covid like situation happens.</p>
