I"+<p>Snapchat grew by creating artificial constraints which made it a small, cool club to belong to</p>
<ol>
  <li>No screenshot</li>
  <li>Could add only people from phonebook</li>
  <li>Had to share an image from camera instantly</li>
  <li>No upload photos</li>
  <li>No likes, no permanence, no social anxiety</li>
  <li>You could reply only with photos =&gt; people started replying with selfies of them reacting to the original post</li>
  <li>To view a snap, you had to hold your finger down on the screen. Meant you had to put attention to a snap. Compare it with scrolling your feed on Facebook/Insta</li>
  <li>Visual, complicated UI meant users were physically onboarding their friends. And teaching them how to use the app and its new features. People who knew hidden features = super cool</li>
</ol>
