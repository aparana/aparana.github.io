I"<p>I recently completed <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33331.More_Than_You_Know">Michael J. Mauboussin’s book ‘More Than You Know: Finding Financial Wisdom in Unconventional Places</a>’. In this book Mauboussin, who is one of Wall Street’s most creative and influential minds, offers provocative new ways of thinking about the stock market, investing, and how we make decisions. I am sharing my favourite parts from the book here. The blog post has been broken down into multiple sub sections to improve readability.</p>
