I"˝<p>Communication is one of the things I talk and tweet about the most. <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/08/11/20-lessons-gojek.html">It is also the area where I am trying to become better</a>. If you are trying to improve in anything, the first task should be to figure out how to measure it</p>

<p><strong>Here is how I am measuring my communication skills at work:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>How often are key stakeholders asking for an update from me because I did not proactively share it.</li>
  <li>If I get an important update/announcement email reviewed by my manager, how many edits he has to do.</li>
  <li>If I have sent out an update, how many follow up questions I am getting which should have been answered in the update itself.</li>
  <li>The number of times people in my team reaches out to me after I write something, saying something on the lines of ‚Äúthat sounded harsh‚Äù or ‚Äúit could have been framed better‚Äù.</li>
  <li>The number of times my Manager has to point out mistakes in something I shared on slack/ email.</li>
  <li>If we have another Growth Framework Review, the score I get on communication.</li>
  <li>How many times my manager has to follow up with me on some message where we were both tagged.</li>
  <li>If I am following the <a href="https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7">pyramid principle of communication or not</a>.</li>
</ol>
