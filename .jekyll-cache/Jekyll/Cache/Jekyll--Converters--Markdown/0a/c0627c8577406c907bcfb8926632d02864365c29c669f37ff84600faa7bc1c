I"­<p>If I ever become moderately successful and can run a team my way, the first rule I will set: If someone has to tag you a dozen times on slack to get a reply from you, and you donâ€™t even bother replying unless your boss is tagged as an escalation, then you should be fired.</p>

<p>What kind of absolute incompetent idiot you have to be to not bother checking mail or slack, or worse ignoring them, knowing that other teams are dependent on you.</p>

<p>My own turn around time (TAT) is one day. Unless I honestly forget about it, and someone has to tag me the 2nd time.</p>

<p>To shame idiots who donâ€™t reply for a week in a P0 task, I now tag their manager in a follow-up mail and mark their dependency item in red color. Also, mark the status as DELAYED/ AT RISK.</p>

<p>It is the only thing that works sadly.</p>
