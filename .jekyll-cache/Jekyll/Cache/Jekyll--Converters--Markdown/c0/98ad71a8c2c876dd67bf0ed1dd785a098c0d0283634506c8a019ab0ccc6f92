I"U<p>Thoughts after more than a month of WFH: Days are getting longer, weeks are getting shorter</p>

<p>When you have the same routine everyday, the day feels long. It is super hard to differentiate between the days of the week, and hence the weeks fly through</p>

<p>Think about what you did the first week of WFH. And now think about the last week. Except becoming more used to staying at home, I guess there wonâ€™t be much difference</p>

<p>I read somewhere that the key to living a long interesting life is to have varied new experiences</p>

<p>And experiences is something for which you need to go out</p>

<p>You can listen to a concert online, but it is not the same<br />
You can watch a travel vlog, but it is not the same</p>

<p>Hence my hypothesis is that though people will appreciate occasional WFHs, video calls, webinars, the world will move back to how it was a few months back; provided we find the Covid-19 cure of course</p>

<p>Lets wait a couple of years and see.</p>
