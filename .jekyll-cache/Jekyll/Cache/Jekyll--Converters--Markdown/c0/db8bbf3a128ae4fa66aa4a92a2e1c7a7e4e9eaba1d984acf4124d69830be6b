  <li>What makes stories great is the detail we add in. Essentially, we need to put meat on the bones of our story and make sure to do
the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Have a hero/protagonist. Decide who will be the
central character of the story. Often people remember the characters more than
the story itself.</li>
      <li>Describe what your hero is up against. What
challenges does the character have to overcome? What do they want and what is
stopping them from getting it? This is your story’s source of tension.</li>
      <li>Build in a specific transcending emotion. You
need something that breaks down barriers; love, lust, greed, passion, and loss
are perfect.</li>
      <li>Include a clear lesson or transformation. Make
sure your characters move towards their goal/objective/solving a problem.</li>
      <li>Add twists and turns to the story. Try not to
make it predictable for the listener. Introduce a question or challenge and
don’t be too quick to solve it.</li>
      <li>Make it believable. It is essential that your
story allows the listener to suspend their disbelief, listening to what you are
saying rather than questioning the truth of your words.</li>
      <li>Have a clear incident that makes the story really
take off. Often referred to as the Inciting Incident, it is a concept
popularized by the master of story, Robert McKee, in his famed three-day “Story
Seminar” given all over the world. It is described by Steven Pressfield, author
of The Legend of Bagger Vance and The War of Art, here: “The
inciting incident in a screenplay or novel is that event that gets the story
rolling. In The Hangover, it’s the moment when the guys wake up in their
trashed villa with no memory of what happened the night before–and realize that
they’ve lost their friend Doug. With that, the story kicks into gear.
Everything before that is just setup. Ask yourself of your project, “What is
the inciting incident?” “When does the ‘story’ take off?” You’d be surprised
how many would-be novels/screenplays/restaurants/startups don’t have inciting
incidents. That’s why they don’t work”.</li>
      <li>Know where you want to end up (the punch line) from
the outset. The last line should be the first line you write. Then work
backwards towards your inciting incident and set up.</li>
      <li>Quickly build in a hook to grab your audience’s
attention and draw them into the story. This is especially important in
light of today’s ever-decreasing attention spans. You’re your audience’s reason
to keep their phones in their pockets.</li>
      <li>Reference your opening lines/setup in the
conclusion of your story. This is referred to as the Bookend Technique and
it will give your story a feeling of completion or symmetry.</li>
    </ul>
