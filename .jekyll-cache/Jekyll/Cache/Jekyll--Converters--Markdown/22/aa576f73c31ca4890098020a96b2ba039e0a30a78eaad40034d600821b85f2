I"2<p>Recently wrote a thread on the PM role. Turning it into a blogpost (with some minor edits)</p>

<p><strong>/threadstarts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There is a joke that people who become PMs are not good at any particular thing and hence they get their MBAs and tell people what to do</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TBH I became a PM because it was the only job where I could be good/amazing at multiple things</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>kind of a brag thread. ignore if you wish</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I have heard this joke/comment so many times in my life from various ICs (devs/designer), that I have learned to not engage and just live with it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>but I could have mentioned how</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was one of the earliest members of Redbus’ team in North East and single handedly doubled their partnerships in the 2 months I was interning with them</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>There was a time when I seriously considered Sales and Marketing as my full time career</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was a dev for 1.5 years where I did both front end (android for a few months) and then backend (node.js)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realised that instead of figuring out how to be one of the best devs in the world, I was reading posts on business strategy and design at night</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I moved to Product the first chance I got</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was following what Derek Sivers calls the <a href="https://sivers.org/kimo">‘no speed limit’</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AND IT WAS EVERYTHING I IMAGINED IT TO BE</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first month I was figuring out how to launch a new BU inside coupondunia</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next 3 months I was sitting with devs, working on how we would build this product. I was not merely telling people what to do</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was reading documentation, figuring out how attribution worked, how to measure if the end customer actually ended up using our offers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I never liked going deep into micro details</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like how a code block should be structured, which design pattern to use etc never excited me</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But thinking in terms of systems did</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And I had the best 3 months ever figuring out how to build this new product</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I learned marketing. I learned copywriting. I learned design. I did cold calls</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also did wireframes for an actual product for the first time  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I built internal dashboards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was amazing learning experience</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was doing more things not to hide my incompetence at a particular skill, but because I was actually good in multiple things</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This realisation helped me fight this huge imposter syndrome I was suffering from, because I was managing a team for the first time and in some cases people almost double my age</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we did well. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-scaled-cashboss-500k-downloads-5-months-manas-j-saloi/">The new business took off</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>I started not just reading but building better habits/models to learn more and incorporate the learnings in my day to day work
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/03/08/how-to-learn.html">Framework on how to learn</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/12/how-to-negotiate-job.html">How to negotiate</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://manassaloi.com/2019/02/23/how-to-make-big-decisions.html">How to make decisions</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://manassaloi.com/2016/01/14/11-habits-change-life.html">Habits to improve productivity</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>As you can see I also have folders for everything I read and liked</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/img/bookmarks_folder_mj.png" alt="Bookmarks folder" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Things I read for each job I held. And also each vertical inside Product Management</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TBH one of my biggest fears was also driving me: What if the same joke that I wrote in the first tweet “PM ko aata kya hain” was true?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was obsessed with proving people wrong</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanted to know more than my Designer, Dev, Data analyst, any IC I worked with</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was not just for ego. It was more than that</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know people think the job of a PM is the easiest</p>
  </li>
  <li>But try
    <ul>
      <li>convincing your TL about cutting scope of a project without understanding the underlying tech changes required</li>
      <li>debating with a designer about interaction on a button without understanding design yourself</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember that no one reports to you. You have no explicit or implicit authority</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if they respect you then it is 90% of the job done</p>
  </li>
  <li>Relevant posts:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://medium.com/@jack/authority-merit-80ad140f990b">Authority and Merit</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://boz.com/articles/influence-over-authority">Influence over Authority</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally this is the reason I read so much. And why with every passing year I want to be at least 10% better in some skill</p>
  </li>
  <li>Because I never wanted
    <ul>
      <li> to be in a room with someone where they are thinking “sala PM hain to kuch bhi bolega”</li>
      <li> to be the person who became a PM because he could not be good in anything</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
