I"ô<p>I have spent a year now working with PMs in my team on their career dev plans. I have seen our 1-1s evolve. We have done endless gap analysis and discussed growth plans. I have also mentored a few other PMs in Gojek. Since I have enjoyed the experience so far I have decided to mentor a small group of early PMs.</p>

<p><strong>What I am thinking:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Start with an hour monthly. It can be a single 1 hour or 2 half-hour slots every 2 weeks.</li>
  <li>We will use the same doc I use for structured 1-1s with the PMs in my team.</li>
  <li>A longer career dev plan will be discussed each quarter. We will focus on all the aspects mentioned here:Â <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/05/11/career-dev-plan.html">Career development plan for PMs</a>.</li>
  <li>Unlike Aristos which had a batch size of 5, this time I donâ€™t have a number in mind. I will just mentor a few people based on my availability.</li>
  <li>I donâ€™t have a time period in mind for this engagement. We can start with 3 months and see if this is helpful. If yes, we will continue. Else, we will just move on.</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically, I will use the same docs/processes I use for running my team but instead of a PM in my team, I will be focused on your growth. This program wonâ€™t be as intense as <a href="https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/21/aristos-pm-coaching.html">Aristos</a>. This will be more of a coaching/mentorship session than me pushing you to read X articles/books by the next session.</p>

<p><strong>Why I am doing this?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>As I grow in my own career, I hope this will help me become a better mentor/coach/manager.</li>
  <li>I want to help others. I have a few mentors in my life and I want to pay it forward.</li>
  <li>It will help me connect and work with a bunch of promising PMs early in their career. If I ever need to hire people or recommend PMs to friends, I can have a pool of promising folks.</li>
  <li>A lot of startups donâ€™t provide the mentorship required by beginner PMs and I think this program can help fill the gap.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Who you should be?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Early PM; You should be already working as a PM. This program is not for people looking to get into Product Management.</li>
  <li>Hungry to grow; You should be someone aspires to be the best in your domain.</li>
  <li>Read books/blogs; You should be willing to read more books on your craft. Learning never stops in our field and getting a PM job is the start and not the end of your career.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What do you need to do?</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Send me a DM on Twitter explaining how you think this will be helpful for you. Write about what you are looking for in a mentor. Send the last book you read related to your job.</li>
  <li>If you want to learn how to do cold DMs better, especially when it comes to requesting referrals or mentorship, listen from around 12:30 mark of <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9jcmVhdG9ybGFiZm0ubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/YzJlNGZiMzktYzA0OS00N2IwLWI3YTEtM2MxODIyNTNjNDU0?ep=14">this podcast</a> till around 23 min.</li>
  <li>Take this seriously. Come prepared for our sessions. If we donâ€™t find this useful, we will part our ways.</li>
</ol>
