A framework for career progression: **HOW -> WHAT -> WHY**

From implementation details to what to implement to Why you are implementing this in the first place

Goal should be to reach a position where you can tell the WHY instead of doing the HOW

Lets take an example of my own growth according to the HOW -> WHAT -> WHY framework

**Before:** As a beginner PM I used to be obsessed with firing the right events, combining multiple events and turning them into a parameter instead of a different event

**Now:** Before I even define the events and parameters, I ask WHAT are the questions we are TRYING to answer here with this feature or experiment's launch and WHY are we launching this in the first place
