title:  "Fear and status"
---

So many B2C companies are growing through a mix of fear (F) and status (S) games.

- Superhuman -> Â Status: Exclusive mail client which top CEOs and VC use because they value their time, Fear: Only way to achieve inbox 0. Imagine missing a mail from a founder which could lead to a B $ exit.

- WhiteHat Jr -> Status: See my kid go to silicon valley because she is a 6-year-old coding prodigy, Fear: Tech is the future. Don't start early and you miss out.

- Clubhouse -> Status: Invite only. Remember to use your invites well. Only iOS, no android peasants, Fear: More like FOMO. We are having these cool convos and you are not invited hahaha. Fear not as strong as Status though in this case.
