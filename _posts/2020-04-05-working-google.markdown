title: "Why I might never apply for a job at Google"

---

One of the reasons why I will never apply for a job at Google or Facebook: Mugging up how to traverse a red black tree did not make much sense to me when I was a dev. You could just open Cormen and look it up. And it sure as hell does not make sense now, with me being a PM with more than half a decade of experience in building Products

Most of these tech interviews are just a signalling exercise: That you are willing to put in the 2-3 months effort required to get a job the top 2 companies in the world; where every dev/PM want to work

Would I like to work at Google someday? Maybe
Am I willing to, or even capable of practicing Data Structures and algorithm questions for 2 months? Probably not

Massive respect for people who can do that though. It is not easy
