title:  "10X framework: Add a Zero to a metric"
---

One of the things I listened on a recent podcast which has stuck with me: Keith Rabois rejecting project ideas at Square which did not add a 0 at the end to a metric

I am calling it the 10X framework

Honest confession: After Coupondunia I have not done a 10X project

Here is the full podcast if you are interested: [Key lessons from Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman, and Jack Dorsey](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9NWno2VmNvcw&episode=MzRiNzc3NWUtYTVhNy00MzVjLWI0NjktYmRjNjRmMjFkOTcw)
