title:  "Feedback and trust"
---

1. Give honest blunt feedback.
2. Build a relationship of trust and mutual respect.

Whenever I rushed to doing 1 without doing 2 first, bad things happened.

Also know that [Radical Candor](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/06/15/notes-from-radical-candor-kim-scott.html), though a great book, does not reflect that reality inside most companies. So thread carefully when it comes to blunt feedback.
