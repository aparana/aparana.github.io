Notes from [Pomp's interview of Brian Norgard](https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vb2ZmdGhlY2hhaW4&episode=ZjVkZjg4N2EtNTE5OS0xMWVhLTlmMjctZWY4ODdlNzVmMDYy&ved=0CBoQzsICahcKEwiQ5OGRnKHoAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBQ&hl=en-IN). This is one of the best podcasts I have listened to in recent times

- People want cheat codes
- Don't make your users think
- The most successful consumer products are dead simple to use. They put users in a state of "no-mind"
- People want to turn off their brains. Hence television worked so much. Don't make users think too much
- Simplify your products
- Give users super power (super like vs like). All superpowers should give a positive experience and have great branding
- People only think of branding of products. They should also think of branding of features
  - Super like: you really like someone
  - Boost: reach more people
- Instead of introducing paywalls, observe existing behavior, extend them, and charge for them
- Let people get to the meat of the application by paying for a cheat code
- Tinder is a video game of variable rewards. Buying Tinder gold is akin to getting cheat code in a game. It allows users to see who already liked them, thereby letting them get to the meat of the product quickly
- When building consumer products you should try to incorporate gaming industry ideas/insights
- Don't teach users how to use your product. Brian does not believe in on boarding. Users should be able to educate themselves
- Match your product with the correct attention span of the user
- All physical technologies follows a similar trend: over time, its size goes from big to medium, from medium to small, and from small to invisible
- People love podcasts because of multimodal consumption â€” you can listen while driving, running, walking to work, etc
