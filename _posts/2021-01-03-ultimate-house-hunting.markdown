## Pre House Hunt

- Be honest about how long do you think you will stay in your new place.
- If it is around a year, then know that with broker fee (anywhere between half and one month) and one month painting charge, you will pay for 12.5 months for the 11 month contract that will be drawn with your landlord.
- This means your actual cost per month will be different than the amount you send to your landlord each month.
- Ideally you should stay for 2-3 years so that these extra 2 months cost gets spread over a longer duration.
- Think about the features you want in your new house and split them into
  - Must have P0
  - Should have P1
  - Nice to have P2
- For me P0s were at least 2 balconies, non ground floor, a large bedroom, built in wardrobes, western style bathrooms, security, good sunlight, not too many restrictions and 24 hours water during summers. P1s were society, attached bathrooms with all the rooms, power backup, well lit kitchen. P1s include everything else.
- P0s were what I communicated to the broker as requirements for the house. Rest I used to analyse myself.

## During the hunt

- Make it clear you will give only half month's rent to broker. If you don't negotiate upfront they will assume full month and hassle you later.
- Ask friends who stay in the area about +ves as well as -ves.
- Confirm if the area floods during the rains.
- Check if there is too much dust in the staircases of the building. It is an indication of how well maintained the place is.
- Try to talk to the guards if it is a society.
- Check the place once during day time and again at night.
- Don't settle on the first house you like.
- Avoid FOMO and say yes only when your P0s are met. You should not have any second thoughts once you move in.

## Once a you like a place and want to confirm it

- Check the tube chocks.
- Check the plug points. Take a charger with you and see if the plug points work.
- Ask about 24 hours power backup.
- Confirm with the owner who will be responsible for repair. Say, your geyser conks out one week inside you moving in, will it be you or he who pays for the repair/replacement?
- Check all the geysers.
- Check for electricity fluctuations. In older buildings wirings are faulty. Only way to check is by doing a load test. Turn on all geysers. Our geyser turned out to be faulty when we did this test and our electricity tripped.
- Check if the bathrooms as well as office room has power backup.
- Check if there are holes for rats/cockroaches to enter.
- Confirm when you should change the inverter oil, if the owner has provided for one.
- Ask about garbage disposal.
- Check shower fittings
- Check water pressure for washing machine tap.
- Check if plushes work properly.
- Ask the owner for existing Wifi connection. Check wifi coverage across the house. Check possible wifi dead zones.
- Ideally the point for the router should have power backup so that you don't lose internet during power cuts.
- Check locks on almirahs. Get the keys for each one of them. If the keys are not there, get it in writing.
- Check condition of dining table and beds if you have been provided with those.
- If you plan to get a new mattress then ask the old mattresses to be removed.  
- Check main door lock.
- Check water pressure in all the bathrooms.
- Check duplicate keys. Ideally the owner should not keep spare keys.
- Check washing machine inlet and outlet pipes.
- Discuss who will pay maintenance. Put it clearly on the agreement.
- Check if the fan makes too much noise at full speed.
- Will be able to get your old furniture, including your king size bed, inside the door?
- Look out for rust on iron rods.
- Check if all the doors can be locked properly; if the latches work fine.
- Ask who will fix heavy electronics if they stop working?
- Who will do fixes if there is water seepage? This is a common problem in old societies.
- Carefully observe the layout of the house is important. Think where you will put all your stuff. I realised that the place where I wanted to put my study table did not have any plug points nearby. So I had to use an extension cord.
- Talk to the neighbours in the absence of the owner or broker.
- Check if there is some new construction going on nearby.
- Ask if there are any restrictions placed by the society: Can you get your food delivered to your doorsteps or do you need to go to the gate? What about house work? Can you drill a hole on the wall, if you have to, at 8PM?
- Check if there is a wash basin near the dining hall.
- Check alignment of tube lights.
- Check for cracks in the walls.
- Check the flooring unless you want your dining table chairs to jiggle.
- Ask the neighbours if there is any water seepage problem in the building.
- Ask the neighbours if there is any cockroach infestation.
- Walk around in the neighbourhood. Can you imagine living there? Sometimes the house might be great but there might be a slum nearby.
- Is there any medical shops nearby?
- If your house is in the outskirts, check if the food delivery apps deliver there.

## Signing the agreement

- Get pan card details of the owner.
- Take photos of everything, including small damages.
- Do an inventory check.
- Let the owner know that you will be responsible for only the items mentioned in the inventory section of the agreement.
- Don't keep useless furniture. If it breaks, the owner will charge later. Best to get them removed. Or make it clear in writing that they are old, might break, and you should not be responsible.
- Owners are desperate during covid. See if you can get the deposit amount cut down.
- Confirm with the owner if you still have to pay for painting charges if you are able to find a replace when you leave and that person is willing to move in without any fixes. Whatever you decided get it in writing.
- Check the agreement for non standard clauses. My owner wanted to put a fine for paying the rent after 5th. I got it removed.
- Check the notice period. Like your job, it should not be move than 2 months.


## The first week
- Once you move in, take photos of all the existing furniture, electronics, and paint again. And mail it to the owner mentioning that it is the state of the place. When you leave you can compare and decided on damages, if any.
- If you make any structural changes make sure you ask for permission and get it in writing. Most owners depend on their properly for livelihood and try their best to cut money from your deposit when you leave.
- If you got anything repaired share it with your owner. They might not compensate you, but they should know that you have spent your hard earned cash in improving the place and are treating it like your home.
- Form a good relationship with the guards, society secretary, and your neighbours. You will need it.
