title:  "Don't force me to cc your manager"
---
If I ever become moderately successful and can run a team my way, the first rule I will set: If someone has to tag you a dozen times on slack to get a reply from you, and you don't even bother replying unless your boss is tagged as an escalation, then you should be fired.

What kind of absolute incompetent idiot you have to be to not bother checking mail or slack, or worse ignoring them, knowing that other teams are dependent on you.

My own turn around time (TAT) is one day. Unless I honestly forget about it, and someone has to tag me the 2nd time.

To shame idiots who don't reply for a week in a P0 task, I now tag their manager in a follow-up mail and mark their dependency item in red color. Also, mark the status as DELAYED/ AT RISK.

It is the only thing that works sadly.
