title:  "So you want to learn Business Strategy?"

---
I wrote a thread recently on the best books I have read on Strategy. Turning it into a blogpost (with some minor edits)

**/threadstarts**

Yesterday I shared a series of posts on Strategy. Strategy is mostly around creating competitive advantage/ moats/ secrets (what Thiel calls it). Here are a bunch of frameworks/posts to think about the same

1. **My fav one: Thiel’s 7 questions**
You can find more here: https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2019/08/23/zero-one-peter-thiel.html
He also explains how Tesla is different from other cleantech companies (check the end of the post)
Zero to One is a must read if you work in startups/planning to startup

2. **Hamilton’s 7 powers:** Scale economics, Network economics, Counter positioning, Switching cost, Branding, Cornered resources, Process power
Something you should read if you are interested in business strategy
Link to notes from the book including explanation of all the 7 powers: https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2019/08/22/seven-powers-hamilton-helmer.html

3. **Munger’s 5 elements which create moats:** Supply-Side Economies of Scale and Scope, Demand-Side Economies of Scale (Network Effects), Brand, Regulation, Patents and Intellectual Property
See the last section of this blogpost to read more on the same: [Charlie Munger: The Complete Investor](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/03/07/charlier-munger-griffin.html)

4. **Platform revolution** has a bunch of frameworks to think about how to build and grow a platform. It is highly relevant if you are working in a startup in the on demand space
Full summary here: Platform Revolution: [How Networked Markets Are Transforming the Economy](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/03/21/platform-revolution-parker-choudary.html)

5. **Blitzscaling** is a good read if you want to understand how to build hyper growth business
It also has a lot of frameworks for growth: things which can turbocharge it or limit it

6. **[Only the Paranoid Survive](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/03/28/paranoids-survive-grove.html)** is a great playbook on surviving 10X changes and has lot of war stories from Intel

Honorary mentions: **Good to great**, **Built to last**, **Blue Ocean Strategy**.
I read them long back. Have to re read and take notes
