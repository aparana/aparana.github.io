title: "You should copy your competitors"

---

**Controversial opinion:** If you have a distribution advantage there is no shame in copying competitors' features

I think Instagram copying Snapchat was the right thing

And Microsoft should just shamelessly copy Slack's features without trying to be original

Most companies I know spend a lot of time iterating on [showstopper](http://www.defmacro.org/2013/09/26/products.html) features, which every competitor has already, compared to focusing on [game changers](http://www.defmacro.org/2013/09/26/products.html). Please don't!

Example. If you are a music streaming company launching today, instead of trying to be original with the Profile section, or with how the Like button should look, focus on creating a game changing feature like Spotify's Discover Weekly (Not the UI but the algorithm which powers it)

Coming to Spotify, Every company is a tech company nowadays. But there are only a few like Spotify who are actually leveraging tech (their recommendations) to build a 10X better product, and thereby making Tech is their moat
