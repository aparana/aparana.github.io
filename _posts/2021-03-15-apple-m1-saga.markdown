title:  "My Apple M1 Macbook Air saga"
---

I had been waiting to buy a personal laptop for a couple of years now.

November comes. Apple releases the M1. Reddit, YouTube, Twitter users go gaga over it.

I get the Mac M1 after months of going through 100+ YouTube videos + dozens of Reddit threads. The first days of using the M1 were brilliant! Fast. The battery lasts 1.5 days.

A couple of days later the problem starts. I start getting a random restart popup. It is hard to reproduce but appears erratically - sometimes a dozen times a day, and sometimes just a couple of times.

I reach out to Apple support. They have no clue. I google and see that other people have faced the same issue [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252249950) and [here](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-air-m1-touch-id-wake-up-issue.2276820/page-2?post=29555181#post-29555181).

For me, I get this prompt, but the laptop does not restart. I know there has to be a deeper issue. Apple support told me to do an SMC reset.I do that but it did not help. I get on a call with 2-3 different Apple support representatives, no one could figure out where the real problem is. Is it hardware, is it software?

Apple Support requests me to the go to the nearby Planetcare. There they claim it is a software issue and that it can be fixed easily.

I drop off my laptop, they reinstall the OS, claim it was under observation and there is no problem. I get it back.The Restart prompts start appearing within an hour. I take it back. This time they say it is a hardware issue. I bring the laptop back to them. Few days later, they *claim* that they have replaced the logic board and the Touch ID button, and now the issue is fixed. They don't give me any documents; to prove they did anything.

I bring the laptop back. The issue is still there. I call Apple support again. They say that Planet care might not have fixed the issue. They tell me now to go to iCare. I take my laptop there. I can reproduce the issue multiple times in front of them.They said that it is fixable. I  keep the laptop with them for a week. They reinstall the OS and give it back. I tell them that this was the same thing Planetcare did. Why would this reinstall fix the issue when it did not get fixed earlier?

iCare tells me: sorry sir, I can't see any repair done by Planetcare. If it was done, then it would show on our portal.

At this point, I am very confused. Which of these service centers is lying and why would they lie? I push iCare to give it in writing that Planetcare did not replace any hardware. The iCare person goes back inside, checks their portal and comes back to say that they can see Planetcare's repair history. And it seems they replaced the logic board. They say with the hardware and now OS reinstall the issue is fixed for sure. I asked if they figured out the root cause. They had no clue. So after arguing for half an hour, I bring my laptop home. This time I don't even log in using my Apple ID. I keep using the user that iCare people had created. They hypothesize that somehow my iCloud data is corrupting the hardware and forcing these restart alerts.

As predicted by me the issue came back. Then it is back to more calls with Apple support and they now claim the PlanetCare people did not repair the hardware and there is no documentation on the same. So 3 different sources: apple support, planetcare, and icare all saying different things. So I have no idea who is lying, where is the issue, and how to fix my goddamn Mac. The useless apple care+ that I paid a premium for has not helped. And it is not just me that is facing this ordeal!

1st gen hardware is always risky. And sometimes it is worth the risk. What is not worth is shitty support from a company that is considered the best in the world for customer delight and also for their premium hardware for which you pay a bomb.

A few more points:
- I did not even mention how much battery rosetta apps consume at the moment. If you use rosetta your battery will last the same as your old intel laptops.
- Apple should fix most of these issues by year-end.
- If I was not facing this issue, I would have probably paid even more for this laptop. I love the 13 inch form factor, the keyboard is pretty good, and I love how fast it is,

**Update on 25th March 2021:** My M1 is still not fixed. It has been 1.5 months, 3 visits  to two different service centers (6 visits if you count both submitting and collecting the laptop back separately), and dozens of calls with Apple Support. Now they are asking me to visit the service center again for the 4th time without a guarantee that this issue will be fixed if I go there. Note that there is a pandemic going on, and there is no other way for me get my laptop fixed than by physically delivery and taking the laptop.It is astounding how bad Apple Support is. Also, I have purchased AppleCare+ for 3 years. I have just given up at this point.

Bonus: The latest person who contacted me from Apple Support is now saying that PlanetCare had in fact replaced my Logic board and Touchid. There is no consistency among there support staff, even though they have a written record of my chats with screenshots. All of them are saying different things every time I get on a call with someone from Support.
