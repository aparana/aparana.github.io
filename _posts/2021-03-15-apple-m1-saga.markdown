title:  "My Apple M1 Macbook Air saga"
---

I had been waiting to buy a laptop for a couple of years now.

Never had a personal laptop since passing out of college. Had bought a spec'ed out Asus in college. It was so good!
Sadly that laptop got affected by a crazy ransomware when I was in Mumbai. I forgot the virus name. It encrypted all my shit and then sent me a demand for bitcoin.

It was like how you see in movies. When I would open the laptop, it would start speaking out the ransom note in a robotic tone. I was like fuck it, let me just reinstall windows. But sadly I had my dropbox desktop app synced to the cloud and it encrypted all my dropbox files too.

I somehow managed to beg dropbox customer support to roll back the files to an older version.

I swore off Windows then. Since then I never bothered getting a personal laptop. Would use the one given by the office for both personal and professional work.

When I left my last company, I thought of getting a new laptop. But there were rumours that Apple would come up with new laptops, new form factor, chip, etc. So I got an iPad instead.

During covid, my office made it clear that they want employees to be more careful and not use work laptop for personal work. They even put software to track usage. Fair enough. I decided to buy a new laptop. But then I read that Apple would be refreshing the Mac line and would be introducing their own chip.

Started using my wife's old 2013 Mac Air for personal work. It needs to be connected to a power source for it to work. It is mad slow. But again, I wanted to see how the M1 turns out.

November comes. Apple releases the M1. Reddit, YouTube, Twitter users go gaga over it.

I am not an idiot. I know 1st get hardware always has issues. I don't pre-order. I wait. I read thousands of reviews. I probably watched at least 100+ YouTube videos + read dozens of Reddit threads before convincing myself it would be fine. I am someone who says No like a hundred times before saying Yes to something. I bought insurance after waiting for years before I convinced myself.

So this was not a snap decision. Anyway, the Mac M1 comes. It is brilliant. Fast. The battery lasts 1.5 days. I tweet about it.

Till now I know that there are issues with M1 if you use a 3rd party USB hub. Saw people raise concerns on swap memory use and it fucking up their hard disks. But it was a risk I was willing to take. I also don't have an external display. So I thought it wouldÂ be okay. A couple of days later the problem starts. I start getting a random restart popup. It is hard to reproduce but appears like a dozen times a day.

I reach out to Apple support. They have no clue. I google. See that other people have faced the same issue [here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252249950) and [here](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-air-m1-touch-id-wake-up-issue.2276820/page-2?post=29555181#post-29555181). BTW this is not the only random restart issue. The M1 is plagued with hardware issues around restart. Just check out Reddit. I get scared.

For me, I get this prompt, but the laptop does not restart. I know there has to be a deeper issue. Apple support tells me to do an SMC reset.

I do that. Does not help. I get on a call with 2-3 different agents, none can figure out where is the real problem. Is it hardware, is it software?

They send me to the nearby Planetcare in Indiranager. They claim it is a software issue. Can be fixed easily.

I drop off my laptop there. They reinstall the OS, claim it was under observation and there is no problem. I get it back. Restart prompts start appearing within an hour. I take it back. This time they say it is a hardware issue. I bring the laptop back to them. Few days late, they *claim* that they replaced the logic board and the Touch ID button, and now the issue is fixed. They don't give me any documents; proof they did anything.

I bring the laptop back. The issue is still there. I call Apple support again. Apple support says planet care might not have fixed the issue. So let's take this to iCare at Gopalan mall. I take my laptop there now. I can reproduce the issue multiple times in front of the support. They say they will fix it. Keep the laptop for a week. Reinstall the OS and give it back. I tell them that this was the same thing Planetcare did. Why would this reinstall fix the issue when it did not get fixed earlier?

iCare tells me: sorry sir, I can't see any repair done by Planetcare. If it was done, then it would show on our portal.

At this point, I am like WTF. Which of these service centers is lying and why would they lie? I push iCare to give it in writing that planet care did not replace any hardware. iCare person goes back inside. Checks their portal. Now say that they can see planet care's repair history. And it seems they replaced the logic board. They say with the hardware and now OS reinstall the issue is fixed for sure. I ask them to bet. I tell them it won't be fixed. I ask if they figured out the root cause. They have no clue. So after arguing for like half an hour, I bring my laptop home. This time I don't even log in using my Apple ID. I keep using the user that Icare people had created. They hypothesize that somehow my iCloud data is corrupting the hardware and forcing these restart alerts.

WTF.

I tell him to share his WhatsApp. I challenge him that I will share the same issue on a video by EOD. I know it will come again, without me logging in to my iCloud account. Only someone really stupid will believe that to be the case.

Yes, the issue is still there. Then I do more calls with Apple support and they now claim the Planetcare people did not repair the hardware and there is no documentation on the same. So 3 different sources: apple support, planet care, and icare all saying different things. So I have no idea who is lying, where is the issue, and how to fix my goddamn Mac. The useless apple care+ that I paid a premium for has not helped. If you don't trust me, just google and you will see a LOT of people having similar issues.

1st gen hardware is always risky. And sometimes it is worth the risk. What is not worth is shitty support from a company that is considered the best in the world for customer delight and also for their premium hardware for which you pay a bomb.

A few more points:
- I did not even mention how much battery rosetta apps consume at the moment. If you use rosetta your battery will last the same as your old intel laptops.
- Apple should fix most of these issues by year-end.
- If I was not facing this issue, I would have probably paid even more for this laptop. I love the 13 inch form factor, the keyboard is pretty good, and I love how fast it is,

I used to consider myself lucky tbh. Most of my electronics purchases have been good. My current TV (Micromax) has lasted 4 years and I never had to buy a more expensive one. I am using the same One Plus 5 I bought more than 3 years back (giving some issues, but works)

Like Poker, purchases also evens out it seems ;)

**Update on 25th March 2021:** My M1 is still not fixed. It has been 1.5 months, 3 visits  to the service center, and dozens of calls with Apple Support. 6 visits if you count both submitting and collecting the laptop back separately. Now they are asking me to visit the service center again for the 4th time without a guarantee that this issue will be fixed if I go there. Note that there is a pandemic going on. It is astounding how bad Apple Support is. Also, I have purchased AppleCare+ for 3 years. I have just given up at this point.

Bonus: The latest person who contacted me from Apple Support is now saying that PlanetCare had in fact replaced my Logic board and Touchid. There is no consistency amongst these support staff. All of them are saying different things every time I get on a call with someone from Support. Basically, they are just gaslighting me.
