At [CashBoss](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-scaled-cashboss-500k-downloads-5-months-manas-j-saloi/) we used to refresh the revenue page in our dashboard every hour. Everyone in the team had access to all our numbers. As our revenue continued to grow, we got even more obsessed with it. We used to even show our revenue on a big TV. But optimizing on the local maxima did not lead to our business grow by [10X](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/04/add-a-zero.html).


At Craftsvilla we did an RCA for even a 2% conversion drop. Sundays were spent obsessing on what we could do over the next week to boost our conversion. It was our north star. But like CouponDunia, we spent way too much time with [dashboard paralysis](https://mobile.twitter.com/jmj/status/1228035392256892937) than thinking about what big problems we could solve for our customers.

[Be data-informed, and not data-driven](https://andrewchen.co/know-the-difference-between-data-informed-and-versus-data-driven/). [Also don't let data decide everything](Stop letting the data decide).
