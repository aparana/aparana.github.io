title:  "Strong opinions, weakly held"

[Strong opinions, weakly held](https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html) is one of my [life principles](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/26/personal-life-frameworks.html).

Some of the strong opinions I held in the past, which I have dropped

1. *Management consultants are con artists who try to hide their lack of deep understanding behind frameworks.* This was something I believed in when I was a fresher out of college. Since then I have worked with my ex-consultants, who are super smart, are organized, can break tough problems, and come up with solutions backed by data. They have a bad reputation because people think consultants don't have skin in the game, which might be somewhat true
2. *Using frameworks is lazy.* I love frameworks now
3. *Making money is evil. If you are passionate about something, then the money does not matter.* Now I think that [money](https://thedeepdish.org/fuck-you-money/) gives you the independence to do whatever the fuck you want in life. The 2020 Manas works as hard as 2013 Manas. The 2020 Manas is also obsessed with building products. The only difference is 2020 Manas can leave his job tomorrow, and live comfortably for 5-10 years on his savings
4. *Fuck friends. I don't need anyone. My life is a single-player game.* Having a girlfriend you emotionally connect with, and you know will be by your side through thick and thin is amazing. Having a few close friends is amazing. I am still a self-centered ass. But with age, I am realizing how much people, not everyone but a few good ones, matter
5. *You don't learn anything at a big company. Most people go there to retire.* I know many people who have traded their startup life for the big 4 (Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Google), and they are super happy. I guess there are pros and cons of everything, and you should not have strong statements about where to work, and how to work
6. *Network like crazy.* This is from the time when I believed proximity is power. I still believe that. But over years I have realised that I hate networking. I hate webinars. I hate going to conferences. But that is me. There are a lot of people who have found their dream jobs thanks to their networking skills. I should not hate on them. Hence I keep my opinions on conferences and webinars to occasional Twitter rants
7. *PMs need to know everything.* My biggest confrontation with my managers, as well as other PMs came because I deep down did not respect them enough. Why? Because someÂ of them were not "technical" enough. Others I found to lack an eye for design. A few managers I thought were far too political. With time I have learned to appreciate the pros of people than judging them because of their cons. If I know someone has mad skills in Excel, should I not try to learn from them than bitching about their lack of coding skills? Took me years to learn this
8. *Office politics is eww. Avoid at all cost.* In an organisation there will always be competition for better roles, bigger charters, resources. Most offices are Darwinian. Either you learn how to deal with it or you startup on your own
9. *Fast growth in your 20s or you are dead.* I have started thinking of my career in decades instead of 5-year chunks. I think most people are too greedy and optimize over short term, instead of focusing on the bigger picture. The book [Catalyst](https://manassaloi.com/booksummaries/2016/05/11/catalyst-chandramouli.html) was a life changer
10. *Fuck soft skills. If you are good these things won't matter.* Nope. Communication matter much more than your tech or design skills. Spend a year in a large organisation and you will know why

**Note:** I will keep expanding this list
