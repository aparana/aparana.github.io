title: "Cutting down my Twitter usage"
---

Since I am always public about my goals, here is a new one: I will try to limit my time on Twitter to just posting links, maybe apart from the occasional joke or two, if I really can't resist. I had been cutting my time on Twitter over the last few weeks by:
1. Turning off notifications. No idea who is quote tweeting me or liking my tweets.
2. Turning off DMs. Not replying to incoming DMs except from people I know really well.
3. Using motion on Desktop web.
4. Deleting tweets every 2 days.
5. Not relying to most comments.

I want to take it a step further by cutting down all my shitposting, and only posting tweets which I think are helpful to my followers. Joking on Twitter, dunking on stupid things I see online has run its course. It used to be fun once. Lately, I am spending way more time explaining myself, justifying my views. Time which can be spent on otherÂ high ROI activities.

Another reason: The number of deaths due to Coronavirus, people like Irfan Khan dying, has reminded me again of how fragile life is. One day you are on top of the world, and the next day you have cancer, and get 2 years to live. Twitter is fun. Is it so much fun that I spend hours chit-chatting with random people I will probably never even meet in real life? Nope.

I have also realized that there are so many things I want to learn in life. Get better at. And no matter how many books I read on design, I won't be a designer unless I spend hours daily on Sketch, and Procreate. Being good at something takes time. This is not just true for Design. It is also true for writing, coding, investing, photography, learning new languages.

Let's see if I can stick to it.

13th June Update: I also got rid of my Linkedin feed thanks to [this script](https://gist.github.com/brunolemos/8e13c5472b0c07d795aa766423569546)
