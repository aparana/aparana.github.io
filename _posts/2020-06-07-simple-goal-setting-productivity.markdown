- [OKRs](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/15/personal-OKRs-2020.html) - Long term; 6 months or a year
- A list priorities in a doc - Short term; 1 month
- [Alarms for todos using your phone's default alarm clock app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.deskclock&hl=en_IN) - Daily

These are the only 3 things you need to set and achieve your personal goals. Goal setting workflows need not be so complex. You don't need to read a dozen books on productivity to understand that finally it is about processes and intent, not tools.

Keep it simple.
