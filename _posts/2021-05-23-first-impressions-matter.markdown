First impressions matter. And your reputation will be made in the [first 3 months](https://manassaloi.com/2021/02/12/90-days.html) of joining a new company.

"Wow, it is her first month and she is already driving major decisions" - I heard a senior leader in my company say this about a new Product lead who had just joined the company. She was off to a flying start and did not take time to establish herself as a leader of her org.

Compare that with people who wait for instructions, don't show agency, and spend the first few months without a plan.

Hence I recommend reading the first 90 days book to everyone joining a new company/role. It will be the difference between an Exceeds expectations and Meet in your first appraisal.

And set the tone for your tenure.
