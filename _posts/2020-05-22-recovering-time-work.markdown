title:  "Getting back your time"

---
A few tips to get your time back:
- [Collaborate async through documentation](https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/23/running-product-team.html).
- End meetings early if you are done discussing the agenda items. Tell people I am giving back your X mins, which always make attendees happy.
- Send an agenda with the meeting invite. Agenda less meetings lead to people digressing and talking random things, without coming to a decision on the open item for which the meeting was called.
- 30 min meetings by default.
- For any meeting the following should be clear: Host who leads the meeting, Decider for the open items, agenda items.
- If the decider is not there, don't call a meeting and waste time.
- If you have a weekly recurring meeting, you can still cancel it if there are no open items to discuss.
- Don't call/attend meetings because there is a calendar invite.
- Remember, most meetings can be an email. And most emails can be a slack message.
- Be protective of your calendar. Decline meetings where you think you don't have anything to contribute.
- If the entire meeting is supposed to be a discussion around a doc, you can just circulate the doc and ask for comments async.
- For me, meetings are an escalation, when all written communication fail.
- Put slots on your calendar when you want to get work done without any distraction. Cancel all meeting invites, unless important, if they clash.
- Keep my Mondays relatively open. Plan for the week so that you have a proactive week than a reactive one.
- Put most 1-1s on a single day. It is Thursday for me. Rest of the days feel free to do deep work.
- Following [these rules](https://manassaloi.com/2020/04/26/rules-project-management.html) will help you run projects well free up your time.
- Delegate.
- [Communicating better](https://manassaloi.com/2020/05/19/master-communication-writing.html) will help you cut useless meetings.
- [Use frameworks](https://manassaloi.com/2020/03/05/pm-frameworks.html) to help people decide over you being part of every decision
