title:  "Overlap"

---

On each screen of your product, there is something you want the user to do and there is something the user wants to do. Example. When a user lands on Andrew Chen's blog, they want to read the post asap, but Chen wants to get their email first so that he can retain and engage that particular user. It is fine if you have a different business goal than the user and want to prioritize it over the user goal. What makes me mad is when I am in a meeting with a stakeholder and that person assumes both goals are the same just to drive their agenda. 

As a PM, I feel that there should be a strong overlap between the things you want to show the user on a screen and the things they actually care about. The smaller the overlap, the more you irritate the user with things they don't care about, the stronger the chance of the user churning.
