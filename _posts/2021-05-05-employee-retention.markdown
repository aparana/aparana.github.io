title:  "Best employee retention strategy"
---

The best employee retention strategy is winning.

If a company is winning, then because of its growth, there are enough opportunities for employees to grow.

If a company is not winning, then everything (promotions, hikes) become zero sum.

Some thrive in it. Most leave.
