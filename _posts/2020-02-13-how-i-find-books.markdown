title: "How I find books to read"

---

A few people have asked me where I find books to read. Apart from finding them on [Goodreads thanks to my friends](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9698257-manas-saloi), I also stalk people who have public book shelfs

Here are a few

- [The Rabbit Hole by Blas Moros](https://blas.com/)

- [Bookschatter](https://bookschatter.com/books/)

- [Maksim Stepanenko's Bookshelf](maksim.ms)
