Why Now?

Why You?

These are two questions that every product builder should ask before building new big bang features/product lines. Something which made sense pre-COVID might not be the best thing to do in this pandemic. 'The WHY build this' is the easier question to answer vs these two. If you are an experienced PM, you already know how to align your Research and BI teams to build a case for a feature.

So ask: Why this is the right thing to build this? Can it wait? Also, why do we think we are in a unique place to tackle this problem/feature?

I will be honest here: I don't have the answers to these questions always. To become better at answering these two questions, I have started writing a [pitch doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ez5NflYwy9DxhAXzg2AA2p0eMLVWg3QgxHatg3Td1zA/edit?usp=sharing) for all big features which require significant resources. I strongly recommend you to do the same.
