title: "The Coronavirus WFH Reading List - 100 of the best"

---

I shared a list of items from my to-read bookmarks folder on Twitter recently. If you are looking for things to read/watch during the next few weeks (while you are working from home hopefully), you might find it useful

Copy pasting the thread here with minor edits

**/startthread**

1/ If you are someone like me who is interested in 'business things', but can't imagine going to a B School, this is a must read

[MBA Mondays](https://mba-mondays-illustrated.com/) 

Had read a few of these but not all

2/ When I started my career I was super confused between choosing Product and Growth roles. I used to read extensively on both, and Growthhackers was a must read site for me

Need to catch up on the new studies here: [Growth Studies](https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies)

3/ Apart from the growth studies, you might want to read the most popular posts in this site: [Growth Hackers](http://growthhackers.com/)

4/ While doing this course on [designing experiments](https://www.coursera.org/learn/designexperiments/home/welcome), I got interested in Stats

So I started reading posts from here: [Statttrek](https://stattrek.com)

Might be worth doing both

I recommended the course here: [Online courses to do as a PM](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/05/online-courses-PMs.html)

5/ A bunch of documentaries I never found time to watch: [25 documentaries](https://highexistence.com/25-documentaries-everybody-should-watch/)
