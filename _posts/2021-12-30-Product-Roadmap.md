> A product roadmap is a shared source of truth that outlines the vision, direction, priorities, and progress of a product over time. It's a plan of action that aligns the organization around short and long-term goals for the product or project, and how they will be achieved. - Atlassian 

The roadmap consists of features (milestones) to be delivered over a period of time. A good roadmap should have clear milestones, launch dates, and the teams responsible. Each milestone can be comprised of epic and each epic can have stories. 

### Epic
A feature that can be delivered or deployed independently (details might include stories, flow diagram, sketches/prototypes, etc.) Timeframe - one or two quarters

### Story 
Smallest unit of business value that can be delivered by the team, part of the feature and timeframe - one sprint

### How to write good user stories 

The INVEST framework by Jill Blake - 

A good user story should be:

- “I” independent (of all other user stories - should not overlap in implementation/concept)
- “N” negotiable (not a specific contract for features)
- “V” valuable (delivers value to the customer)
- “E” estimable (delivers should be able to estimate the effort required)
- “S” small (so as to fit within one sprint)
- “T” testable (in principle, even if there isn’t a test for it yet)

For example, for a booking feature (epic), the stories could be built along the customer journey (select the service, select the doctor, select date and time, make payment, confirmation, reschedule/cancel) 

Format: As a [type of user/user persona], I want [an ability] so that [some benefit/value/reason]

Example: As a customer making an appointment, I want the ability to select a date for a future appointment so that I can self-complete the booking process. 

JIRA can be used as a tool with the issue Type as Milestone. 

### OKR vs Roadmap 
More about OKR [here](https://aparanagupta.com/2021/12/30/OKR.html)

OKRs are the objectives to achieve and the roadmap shows what is required to achieve those. For example, if KR is to close x deals then the roadmap might include release y, launch z campaign, etc.
