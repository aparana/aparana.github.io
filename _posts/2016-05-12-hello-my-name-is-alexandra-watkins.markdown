**This blogpost is not an exhaustive summary of the book. Just contains the notes I took**  

#### SMILE: The 5 Qualities of a Super-Sticky Name

* Suggestive — evokes something about your brand
* Meaningful — resonates with your audience
* Imagery — is visually evocative
* Legs — lends itself to a theme for extended mileage
* Emotional —moves people

#### SCRATCH: The 7 Deadly Sins

* Spelling challenged —looks like a typo
* Copycat —is similar to competitors’ names
* Restrictive —limits future growth
* Annoying —is forced or frustrates customers
* Tame —is flat, descriptive, uninspired
* Curse of Knowledge —makes sense only to insiders
* Hard to pronounce —is not obvious or is unapproachable
