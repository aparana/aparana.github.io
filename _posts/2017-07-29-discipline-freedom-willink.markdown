**Note:** While reading a book whenever I come across something interesting, I highlight it on my Kindle. Later I turn those highlights into a blogpost. It is not a complete summary of the book. These are my notes which I intend to go back to later. Let's start!

- One day I asked him about it; he said his goal was to elevate his feet above his heart and sleep for ten to fifteen minutes before he ate his lunch. He said the nap gave him energy. Elevating his feet above his heart took the strain off the circulatory system in his lower body and helped move some of the blood that might have pooled in his feet and legs.

- My workouts are divided into some broad types of movements: Pull, Push, Lift, Squat. In addition to those, the workouts focus working the “Gut” and metabolic conditioning.
