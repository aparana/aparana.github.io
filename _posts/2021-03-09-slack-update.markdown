title:  "Slack update"
---

A good product release update on slack:
1. Has the most important takeaway at the top. Should not be more than a couple of lines
2. Background/ Context as the first section. Add a small paragraph for people to understand the product better.
3. Bullet points for each section.
4. Impact, both in terms of metrics moved as well as customer feedback.
5. Learnings and next steps.
6. Shout out to collaborators.
7. Links to relevant docs, including the product spec, for people who want to dig deeper.
8. Seeks help on the next steps, if relevant.
9. Gets people excited.
10. Tags relevant stakeholders for whom the update is most relevant.
11. The update is broken into relevant sections (sections are mentioned above).
12. Has emojis.

Not related to the update, but equally important: Anticipate questions on the update, especially the impact numbers, and be ready with more relevant data to back the update.

This is mostly for Slack. For a more detailed email update, check out the templates here:  [Email templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ATci-GiUkTZFCVTQliKr1t3zco_aUJmlvY8jMYmR-80/edit?usp=sharing).
