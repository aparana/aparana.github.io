title:  "How to grow Ola"
---

Disclaimer: I don't have any inside info of Ola. This is a basic framework for growing any on demand ride hailing product.

If I was the CEO of Ola, here is how I would think about growing Ola's revenue. Growth can either be [1% experiments or big bets](https://manassaloi.com/2020/12/17/experiments-bigbets.html), but finally it all boils down to the following framework. Don't bother about the exact ideas below. Those are just placeholders.

Revenue growth = Order Growth * Ticket size expansion

Order Growth = Market Expansion * Category expansion * Use case expansion * Top of the funnel improvement * Product funnel conversion * User funnel conversion

Ticket size expansion = Up sell * Pricing experiments * More fees

Market Expansion = Country or Region expansion; think about where the next phase of growth will come from
- Expansion in more cities in India
- Entering new countries

Category expansion = More categories in existing cities or introducing completely new categories
- Wheelchair/ Disabled booking
- Child (school commute use case)

Use case expansion = Cater to new use cases
- Book via SMS
- Book via call center (for people who find the app flow tough to navigate)

Top of the funnel improvement = Get more users to enter the booking funnel
- Better targeted mails
- Better push notifications

Product funnel conversion = EBCR and BCR improvement from X to Y
- Homepage experiments
- Vouchers

EBCR = Estimate screen to Confirm booking conversion
BCR = Booking confirmed to Booking completed conversion
X = Current conversion %
Y = Conversion % we want to reach

User funnel conversion = How to improve % of power users
- Better targeting through vouchers
- Better notifications
- Better retargeting 
- Better experience for first time users

Ticket size expansion = Up sell * Pricing experiments * More fees
- Up sell users to Premium and Large
- Personalised pricing
- Experiment with waiting, cancellation, schedule, multi stop and edit fees
