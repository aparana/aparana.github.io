title:  "Yo Manas, Who don't you startup man?"

---

When someone asks me this question, they always have a follow up statement like

- Working for some one else would never make you rich
- If you are such a smartass who keeps telling other people how do things, it only makes sense that you should more skin in the game
- You will never achieve the autonomy and impact you seek if you work for someone else

I have had so many people ask me this question in my life that I have formed a standard answer by now

Here are the some of the reasons why someone would startup IMHO (decreasing order of importance)

**1/ You have a really strong view of the world/ have a big problem to tackle (which is beyond making apps)**

You
- believe in decentralisation and are wary of governments and their power -> crypto currency startups
- think open source alternatives should exist -> gitlab vs github, mattermost vs slack- micro finance in the third world, better ways to provide credit -> tala -  safe drinking water to people in developing countries -> charity:water

 I really don't have a strong view about the world (at least as of now). I am jealous of people who do

**2/ You are unhappy about the status quo**

You can't imagine how bad the commuting experience is (uber origin), had bad experience with banks and want to reimagine how banks should operate in the digital age (neobanks), want to put software on the cloud (salesforce), you think AI can automate services industry such as legal (atrium)

I am okay with the status quo. What is the status quo for me?

- ability to order a ride/food in 5 secs thanks to ride hailing products
- booking an appointment with a doctor online
- services of most banks
- having a maid clean my dishes, my bathroom

Can these experiences get better? Sure
Is the status quo bad enough for me to spend the next 10 years of my life fixing it? Probably Not

**3/ You want more autonomy and control**

[This is a nice post on autonomy vs impact](!https://avichal.com/2017/03/20/autonomy-vs-impact/)

I have been lucky enough to become a [manager one year out of college](!https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-became-product-manager-manas-j-saloi/). I started taking calls on what do build, how to build, influence the direction of products, move metrics when most of my peers were just getting started on the corporate ladder

Thanks to working for startups always I have always had a certain level of autonomy and control 

[My linkedin](!https://www.linkedin.com/in/manassaloi/) has enough examples of products I have shipped in the past and also recos from my past managers . For a couple of months at Coupondunia, I was even given % of revenue earned from Cashboss (the first product I built from scratch) 

In my current role, I look after a product which has millions of transactions daily, is used in multiple international markets and is literally changing lives for people . With each passing day my team is growing and we are getting to tackle bigger challenges. A small bug causes loss of transactions which is more than DAU of some of the startups I worked at previously

Are there people with better impact on the world? Are there people who have more autonomy than me? Fuck yeah. There are 18 year old kids who have raised millions in the valley. They will be running Billion dollar startups by the time they are 25

Do I feel bad for myself because I could not achieve the same? No. Because of reasons mentioned in 1/ and 2/ and also more which I will share below. Just wanted to point out that you can have autonomy and control without startup up too


**4/ You want to accelerate your learning/ growth**

This is a fair reason. Building your own high growth startup is one way of hacking the corporate ladder as well as to learn more in a shorter time frame. I would argue you can have a similar learning experience while working at a fast growing startup as a TL/ PM


**5/ Make money**

You know that there is enough dry powder in the valley (even India). Pizza startups are worth Billions. People who are probably not smarter than you are getting richer by the day.  Working for some one else would never make you rich

This is again not something I care about. Do I think about it sometime? Yes. I am only human. Do I care enough to get my shovel in the gold rush? No

When I was passed out of college I was super ashamed about my low salary. My dad was pissed that because of my low CGPA I could not even sit for the interview for Microsoft inspite of passing out from BITS. He thought I was dumb enough to join a startup (maybe thinking deep down that I don't even qualify for a TCS or something)

Six years down the line I earn more than 10X of my starting salary. I stay in nice hotels. I get to travel across south east asia, eating fancy breakfast buffets. I have more than 5 years worth of Fuck You money (which is increasing every month)

It is more than enough for me. I have limited needs. Give me my Kindle, a spot in the Veranda, some food, and you would not hear from me for days. I also realised much early in my life that the breakfast buffet tastes good only the first time. After a few times it taste like any other meal

But Manas you still argue for a bigger raise during appraisals right? You still want new companies to give you more than a standard hike during salary negotiations? Yes, I do. But only because I think I am good. I have worked hard in my life to reach where I am right now. And if I think people are getting paid much more to deliver the same value at an Org I will seek parity in terms of pay and other benefits. Again, I am just human

**6/ You want to get into Harvard. A startup will look good in your resume**

I don't want to get into any B School. I can't imagine running around completing assignments, arguing for more marks/grades in my papers. Did all that once in my life during my undergrad days. Don't want to go through again

Also everyone is trying to hack their B School applications nowadays by putting in their co-founder credentials. Not sure how long that trick will work

**7/ You are in Tech /Design /Marketing and want to get into management**

I have seen people do start ups and then jumping into a PM role a few years later thanks to acquisition by a bigger company. Not relevant for me

**8/ You want to get into VC**

To be honest the VC word fascinates me

There are a few ways to enter VC
- Exit as a founder
- Great B School followed by consulting gig
- Journalism / knowing people in the industry to be able to get proprietary deal flow
- Years of operating experience at fast growing startups

Starting up looks like the easiest and quickest option out of all of these

But then again probably not the right reason to do a startup

**9/ You have an extreme personality. You are the kind of person who can't just work for others. You will be a shitty employee if you work at another company**

aka The Steve Jobs path

Don't think I have such a personality 

**10/ You have a safety net thanks to earning a lot of money early in your career till now or You have family money**

You want to take the risk and see what happens

Again, both are not true for me. I am from a middle class background. I don't think I have earned enough that I can spend the next 5 years working on something just to see what happens

**11/ You are willing to give the next 5-10 years of your life apart from one or more reasons mentioned above**

I have always been the [kind of person who does a lot of things, who has hobbies and want to not be married to a particular interest](! https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/01/getting-shit-done-happiness.html)

Giving 10 years of my life to something unless it is for reason 1/ or 2/ mentioned above sounds stupid to me

TBH I think the only real reason you should do a startup if it is for reason 1/ or 2/. But then it is my opinion and you can tell me to shove it up my ass. Also I am not a startup founder myself, so why should you listen to me for startup advice

This is again a post written from my POV. On reasons I have not started up. No need to rant on Twitter saying you don't agree

**12/ You are trying to find a reason for doing a startup and not 10 to not to**

Self explanatory ;)

This post is something I wrote after making a statement on Twitter about why people should not startup just to [chase prestige](!https://www.bennettnotes.com/post/obsessed-with-success-and-prestige/)
