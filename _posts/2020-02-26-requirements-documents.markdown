There are 2 ways to write a requirements document

- For a product spec, I prefer focussing on the following:
  - WHY
  - WHAT
  - HOW right; basically the 3 elements you need for product development
It is part of the spec template I shared here: [Twitter emoji spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sUX-sm5qZ474PCQQUpvdi3lvvmWPluqHOyfXz3xKL2M/edit#heading=h.wtx9vk4byf)Â 

- For a document on the improvement of an existing workflow/process, the focus should on
  - Outcome we want after the new workflow is set up
  - What is the current workflow
  - Gaps in the current workflow which are avoiding us getting the outcome we want
  - Path to the outcome
I have not yet shared a template for this, but it something I want to do eventually!
