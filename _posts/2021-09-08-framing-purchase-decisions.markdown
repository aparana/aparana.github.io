title:  "Framing purchase decisions"
---

One way of framing purchase decisions: what % of my salary is worth achieving something.

2500 bucks/annum for a meditation app looks steep, but when you ask yourself what % of your yearly salary you are willing to spend for your mental health, it does not seem so high anymore.

Another frame I use: If I am okay spending 1K on a swiggy order without thinking, I should not overthink buying something that is going to help me become a better person.

Comment from someone when I tweeted out the above: If I'm ever unsure about a purchase because it'sÂ  my first-time, I ask myself "Would I spend this much on a couple of swiggy orders?" If the answer is yes, then I buy it. No point pinching pennies just because of unsurity. It's worked well for me.
