While reading [Amazon Unbound by Brad Stone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56695159-amazon-unbound), I came across this excerpt on Amazon AWS's weekly metrics roulette. I know Stripe does something similar according to [this profile by the Information of their CPO](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-stripe-founders-right-hand-man). It is interesting to see how companies formed decades apart decided to incorporate similar practices to develop a data driven culture.
