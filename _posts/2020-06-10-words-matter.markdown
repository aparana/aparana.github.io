title:  "Words matter"

---

Titles matter.
Name of projects matter.
Name of teams inside organisation matters.
Whether you call a doc a Strategy doc or a Product doc matters.
Writing [WIP] in front of a spec's name, if it's not yet frozen, matters.
Calling a design high-fidelity or low matters.

I never realised the importance of words, and the correct naming, till I became a PM.
