title:  "Words matter"

---

- Titles matter.
- Name of a project matters.
- Whether you call it an objective, or a KR, or an initiative inside a KR matters.
- Name of teams inside organisation matters.
- Whether you call a doc a Strategy doc or a Product doc matters.
- Writing [WIP] in front of a spec's name, if it's not yet frozen, matters.
- Calling a design high-fidelity or low matters.

I never realised the importance of words, and the correct naming, till I became a PM.
