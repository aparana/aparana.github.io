title:  "Craftsvilla learnings"

---

Leading mobile apps at Craftsvilla was my 2nd job in product management. I maintained a [learnings doc](https://manassaloi.com/2019/11/24/build-measure-learn.html) at the job. Sharing the notes from there with minor edits.

- Always measure the performance of campaigns.
- Every action should be measurable. If you are making a product change or implementing a growth idea you should write down the quantitative impact it might have.
- Always ask for a date for open items. Never leave a meeting without a follow-up mail with action items and a date on deliverables.
- Do optimization for tablets. Don't forget a platform just because your users are on Mobile.
- Analyze traffic from various acquisition channels daily.
- Optimise push notification opens. Check the open rate for notifications you are sending.
- Before you make decisions based on some dashboard make sure the data is correct everywhere. I took a long time to realize session data on GA was not right.
- Be more proactive in putting ideas across. The 'rate us prompt' could have been implemented far earlier. Just because you discuss an idea don't assume it will be implemented.
- Don't wait for the next big release to club design fixes. Whenever you find a [broken window](http://www.vanschneider.com/the-broken-window-theory/), fix it.
- Make small design fixes live as soon as you can.
- Don't outsource development.
- Don't do big resigns and rewrites together.
- Talk to actual customers and not fellow employees to understand customer behavior.
- Keep asking if the information architecture of every page is right. The first fold of a PDP should have enough information for a user to make the purchase if he wants. Put all critical info at the top. Don't make the user search for it.
- Before adding a new process understand its cost and ROI.
- Always make sure you have 1-1s. Don't get lazy and skip them. 1-1s are not optional.
- If you have a major sales campaign coming up don't make a deployment one day before.
- Don't push anything on Prod which has not gone through the entire testing loop.
- Always provision for important messages on the home page. If you are having a Diwali sale and want to communicate that there might be delays, then you should have had to make an app release. There should be a toggle to turn on these messages.
- There should be one CTA per product card. Example. Don't add both View and Share product CTAs coming up prominently on the card.
- Move to a design system over time. The website should not look drastically different from your app. CTA button colors should not vary drastically across the product.
- Wrestle with reality. Be optimistic, but know the ground reality. PR is not reality.
- Never say anything about a person you would not say to them directly.
- Create a culture where it is OK to make mistakes but unacceptable not to identify, analyze, and learn from them.
- Always learn from your mistakes. Set up processes to avoid repeated mistakes.
- Ask whether you have earned the right to have an opinion. Do your homework.
- Take notes in a meeting and share with all stakeholders. The notes taker can drive the agenda.
- Have a clear owner for each meeting and send the agenda before the meeting.
- Find a short-term resolution of the issue. Don't wait too long to fix a production issue. RCA can happen later. Also, figure out the steps for long-term solutions. Have clear owners for action items.
- Have morning standups. Late day standups don't work.
- Give projects names.
- Have Friday demos.
- Always keep an eye out for tactics that have not yet succumbed to the law of shitty click-throughs.
- Run cheap tests to validate your hypotheses.
- Always have goals. Where do you want to be after a year?
- Write documentation.
- Images are better than words. Showing is better than telling. Working prototypes > Marvel prototypes > Images > Documents > Verbal. Add screenshots to your documents.
- Capture all important decisions in a doc and make sure all key stakeholders have opted-in.
- Hire people better than you.
- If your retention strategy is changing the notice period from 1 to 3 months notice then you might have already failed as a company.
- Send welcome emails for new recruits. Create a 30 days plan for them.
- Think JTBD while designing.
- Do regular research.
- Every week go through play store reviews to understand the sentiment of customers. Don't use generic replies for customer complaints. It is the easiest way to lose trust.
- Optimise your Playstore page to improve top of the funnel acquisition.
