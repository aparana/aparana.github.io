title:  "Discussing politics at work"
---
The woke mob is shitting on Jason and DHH, but I strongly agree with [Basecamp's new policies](https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5). IMHO a company is supposed to create an environment where people come and do their best work without having to align to one side of the political spectrum.

Want to be activists and offer your 2c on every political issue? Sure, do that in your free time. The company slack channel is not the place for it. I am surprised that it is even a controversial opinion.

Even more extreme position that I hold: Society (+most) Whatsapp groups should not have political discussions. I am there to know why the water pump did not run as per schedule. I don't go there to learn about Modi's covid performance report.

(Just my thoughts. Does not reflect my employer yada yada.)
