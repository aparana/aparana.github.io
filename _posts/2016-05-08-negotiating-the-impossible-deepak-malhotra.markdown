**Note:** While reading a book whenever I come across something interesting, I highlight it on my Kindle. Later I turn those highlights into a blogpost. It is not a complete summary of the book. These are my notes which I intend to go back to later. Let's start!


**THE	POWER	OF	FRAMING**

+ Control	 the	 frame	 of	 the	 negotiation.	 The	 frame	 that	 takes	 hold	 will	 shape	 how negotiators	make	decisions,	evaluate	options,	and	decide	what	is	acceptable.

+ Convincing	 the	 other	 party	 that	 they	 will	 have	 to	 concede	 or	 withdraw	 from	 initial positions	is	not	enough.	You	have	to	make	it	easier	for	them	to	back	down.

+ It is	a	good	idea	to	educate	the	other	side	 at	the	outset	about	the	limits	of what	you	can	offer	and	about	the	areas	where	you	have	more	or	less	flexibility.

**NEGOTIATE	STYLE	AND	STRUCTURE,	NOT	JUST	THE	SUBSTANCE**

+ The	breakthrough	came	when	we	noticed	a	flaw	in	how	we	were	going	about	the	discussion:	we
were	stuck	negotiating	royalty	rates	in	one	dimension	( over	time),	 when	 our	 differing	 perspectives
made	clear	that	two	dimensions	were	in	play:	the	passage	of	 time	and	the	quantity	of	 sales.	 Maybe
we	 could	 leverage	 this	 to	 create	 a	 royalty	 schedule	 that	 went	 both	 up	 and	 down.	 If	 the	 other	 side
needed	to	show	rates	going	down	over	time,	perhaps	we	could	accommodate	this	and	still	safeguard
our	financial	interests	when	the	product	sold	more.

**PAY	ATTENTION	TO	THE	OPTICS	OF	THE	DEAL**

+ Pay	attention	to	the	optics	of	the	deal.	It’s	not	just	the	substance	of	what	you	offer	that
 matters,	but	how	it	looks	to	your	negotiating	partners	and	to	their	audience.

**HELP	THE	OTHER	SIDE	SELL	IT**

+ Think	 about	 how	 the	 other	 side	 will	 sell	 the	 deal,	 and	 frame	 the	 proposal	 with	 their
 audience	in	mind.

**MAKE	 IT	SAFE	 FOR	THE	OTHER	SIDE	TO	ASK	FOR	HELP**

+ The	safer	you	make	it	for	the	other	party	to	tell	you	the	truth,	the	more	likely	they	are	to	do	so.

+ Build	 a	 reputation	 for rewarding	transparency	and	not	exploiting	their	moments	of	weakness.

**AVOID	ONE-ISSUE	NEGOTIATIONS**

+ Avoid	 negotiating	 over	 a	 single	 divisive	 issue.	 Add	 issues	 or	 link	 separate	 one-issue
 negotiations.

**NEGOTIATE	MULTIPLE	ISSUES	SIMULTANEOUSLY**

+ Negotiate	multiple	issues	simultaneously	to	help	identify	wise	trades	and	to	reduce	the
 risk	that	concessions	will	not	be	reciprocated.

+ Don’t	let	any	single	issue	become	too	prominent.	Educate	your	audiences	about	how	to
 measure	success,	and	limit	the	amount	of	attention	given	to	any	one	issue.

+ There	is	another	strategy	for	avoiding	a	win/lose	outcome:	split	the	one	issue	into	two
or	more.	This	is	what	the	NFL	negotiators	did	by	splitting	one	revenue	number	into	three	separate	revenue
“buckets.

+ It	may	be	possible	for	both	sides	to	meet	their	underlying	interests	(getting	a	higher
raise,	staying	within	budget),	but	this	will	only	happen	if	they	stop	arguing	about	“what	they	want,”
and	 start	 discussing	 their	 motivations	 for	 “why	 they	 want	 it.”	 This	 is	 referred	 to	 as	 shifting	 from
 positions	 (what	 people	 want)	 to	  interests	 (why	 they	 want	 it).

+ Be	as	firm	as	needed	on	substance;	be	as	flexible	as	possible	on	style	and	structure.

**GETTING	UNSTUCK	IS	A	WORTHY	ENOUGH	SHORT-TERM	GOAL**

+ A	 wisely	 framed	 proposal	 need	 not	 resolve	 the	 entire	 dispute.	 Sometimes	 just	 getting
 unstuck	is	the	key	to	paving	the	path	towards	eventual	agreement.

+ The	logic	of	appropriateness	tells	us	that	many	of	the	choices	people	make	are	based	on
 how	they	answer	one	simple	question:	What	does	a	person	like	me	do	in	a	situation	like
 this?

+ Leverage	social	proof	 to	boost	the	appropriateness	of	your	proposal.

+ Framing	an	option	as	unique	might	make	it	more	intriguing	but	less	attractive.

+ Present	your	proposal	as	the	default	option	to	boost	its	appropriateness.

+ There	 is	 a	 clear	 advantage	 to	 being	 the	 party	 who	 presents	 the	 initial draft	or	whose	standard	contract	will	be	used	as	the	template	for	the	deal.	In	my	experience,	many	items
that	reside	in	boilerplates—even	some	important	provisions	that	have	a	substantive	impact	on	the	value	of
the	 deal—often	 go	 unchallenged	 or,	 because	 they	 are	 included	 in	 the	 standard	 contract,	 are	 not	 haggled over	as	aggressively	as	they	would	be	had	they	only	been	proposed	orally	by	the	other	side.

+ As	with	other	factors that	 influence	 framing,	 the	 longer	 a	 default	 persists,	 the	 harder	 it	 is	 to	 change.	 

+ Establish	a	proper	reference	point.	Even	generous	proposals	can	be	evaluated	negatively if	the	other	side’s	reference	point	is	not	set	appropriately.

+ Always	justify	your	offer,	but	don’t	apologize	for	it.

+ When	 neither	 side	 is	 willing	 to	 openly	 subordinate	 its	 demands	 on	 key	 issues	 or principles,	 strategic	 ambiguity—language	 that	 is	 deliberately	 open	 to	 multiple interpretations—can	help	the	parties	reach	an	agreement

+ Strategic	ambiguity	should	be	used	only	when	other	mechanisms	are	in	place	to	ensure compliance	with	appropriate	behavior.

+ Strategic	 ambiguity	 can	 help	 parties	 initiate	 relationships	 when	 there	 is	 insufficient trust	for	full	commitment,	but	where	being	explicitly	noncommittal	is	unacceptable.

+ There	 is	 a	 powerful	 first-mover	 advantage	 in	 framing.	 Whenever	 possible,	 seek	 to control	the	frame	of	the	negotiation	at	the	start.

+ If 	the	existing	frame	is	disadvantageous,	seek	to	reframe	as	soon	as	possible

+ Disputes	 are	 easier	 to	 preempt	 than	 to	 resolve.	 Decisions	 can	 sometimes	 be	 framed	 in + ways	that	help	people	avoid	confrontation	in	the	first	place.

+ Early	 actions	 can	 take	 on	 heightened	 significance.	 Look	 for	 low-cost	 opportunities	 to powerfully	 influence	 the	 frame	 and	 to	 establish	 the	 appropriate	 expectations	 and + precedents	for	the	relationship

+ **Here	 are	 just	  a	 few elements	of	process	to	consider	and	try	to	shape:**
  * How	long	will	negotiations	last?
  * Who	will	be	involved	and	in	what	capacity?
  * What	will	be	on	the	agenda,	and	in	what	order	will	issues	be	discussed?
  * Who	will	draft	the	initial	proposal?
  * Will	negotiations	be	public	or	private?
  * When	and	how	will	progress	be	reported	outside	of	negotiations?
  * Given	multiple	parties	or	issues,	will	there	be	one	negotiation	track	or	many?
  * Will	all	the	parties	be	in	the	same	room	at	the	same	time?
  * Will	negotiations	take	place	face-to-face	or	via	technology?
  * How	many	meetings	will	be	scheduled?
  * How	will	major	deadlocks	or	other	problems	be	managed?
  * Will	there	be	outside	observers	or	mediators?
  * Will	deadlines,	if	any,	be	binding	or	not?
  * What	milestones	might	help	build	momentum	and	keep	the	process	on	track?
  * If	the	negotiations	end	in	no	deal,	when	and	how	might	parties	reengage?
  * Who	are	the	parties	that	need	to	ratify	the	deal,	and	how	much	support	is	sufficient	for	passage?
  * In most	 negotiations,	 some	 or	 many	 of	 these	 factors	 will	 be	 predetermined,	 or	 there	 may	 be	 a
default	 process	 in	 place	 due	 to	 precedent	 or	 the	 actions	 of	 other	 parties.	 But	 as	 we	 have	 seen,
defaults need	not	be	blindly	accepted—they	can	be	reset	to	great	advantage.
  * Have	a	process	strategy:	how	will	you	get	from	where	you	are	today	to	where	you	want to	 be? Consider	 the	 factors	 that	 influence	 whether,	 when,	 and	 how	 substantive negotiations	will	occur.

+ A	 process	 strategy	 for	 deal	 making	 is	 not	 enough—you	 also	 have	 to	 strategize	the implementation	process.	What	will	be	required	for	successful	implementation?

+ How	will you	garner	sufficient	support	for	the	deal?	How	will	you	ensure	ratification?

+ Be	the	most	prepared	person	in	the	room.	Know	the	facts,	anticipate	the	arguments,	and understand	your	weaknesses.

+ Negotiate	process	before	substance.	Understand	and	influence	the	process	before	diving too	deeply	into	substantive	discussions	or	concession	making.

+ Misalignment	 on	 process	 can	 derail	 deals.	 Ensure—early	 and	 often—that	 there	 is agreement	about	what	has	been	accomplished	and	what	the	path	ahead	looks	like.

+ Even	if	you	cannot	influence	the	process,	seek	to	get	as	much	clarity	and	commitment on	it	as	possible. Normalize	 the	 process.	 If	 other	 parties	 know	 what	 to	 expect,	 they	 are	 less	 likely	 to overreact	to	or	overweight	the	significance	of	doubts,	delays,	and	disruptions.

+ Encourage	others	to	normalize	the	process	for	you—and	make	it	safe	for	them	to	do	so.

+ The	risk	of	reneging	is	lower	when	commitments	are	personal,	explicit,	unambiguous, and	public.

+ These	 are	 five	 very	 important	 elements	 to	 consider	 before	 disengaging	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 process
conflict:
  * Can	we	be	sure	it	was	a	breach,	or	does	the	other	side	have	reasons	to	see	things	differently?
  * Do	we	bring	sufficient	value	to	the	table,	and	does	the	other	party	understand	this?
  * Can	we	justify	our	actions	on	the	basis	of	acceptable	principles?
  * Have	we	clarified	what	would	be	required	to	fix	the	breach?
  * Have	we	given	the	other	party	a	face-saving	way	to	return	to	the	table?


+ Commitment	 to	 a	 rigid	 process	 is	 not	 always	 possible	 or	 advisable.	 If	 the	 process	 is flexible,	make	sure	all	parties	understand	the	degree	to	which	there	is	commitment.

+ Preserve	forward	momentum.	Before	using	tactics	to	gain	advantage,	consider:	how	will this	affect	our	ability	to	negotiate	productively	in	the	future?

+ Consensus	 deals	 can	 be	 shortsighted.	 As	 the	 number	 of	 parties	 with	 veto	 power increases,	the	degrees	of	freedom	for	deal	structuring	decreases.

+ In	 complex	 deals	 and	 protracted	 conflicts,	 especially	 if	 hostage	 taking	 is	 a	 concern,	 a sufficient	consensus	approach	can	be	more	appropriate	than	seeking	unanimity.

+ Keep	 a	 low	 bar	 for	 progress,	 but	 a	 high	 bar	 for	 final	 agreement.	 

+ The	 principle	 of	 “nothing	 is	 agreed	 until	 everything	 is	 agreed”	 can	 help	 overcome paralysis	by	allowing	people	to	make	concessions	safely

+ Transparency	 during	 the	 bargaining	 process	 can	 stifle	 progress.	 Give	 negotiators	 the  privacy	 they	 need	 to	 structure	 the	deal;	 give	 constituents	 the	 right	 to	 decide	 whether	 the deal	is	acceptable

+ Most	 negotiations,	 even	 successful	 ones,	 leave	 residual	 conflict	 in	 their	 wake.	 Create
 channels	and	processes	to	manage	subsequent	flare-ups	and	latent	conflict.

+ Stay	 at	 the	 table,	 especially	 after	 failed	 negotiations,	 to	 sustain	 relationships, understand	the	other	side’s	perspective,	and	look	for	opportunities	to	reengage.

+ Parties	 can	 get	 bogged	 down	 with	 process	 concerns	 when	 there	 is	 inadequate preparation,	an	unrealistic	goal	of	crafting	the	perfect	process,	or	an	excessive	desire	for strategic	flexibility.

+ When	power	relations	are	unclear	or	unstable,	process	negotiations	can	become	proxy wars	for	leverage	and	legitimacy,	endangering	substantive	negotiations

+ Resisting	 unfair	 demands	 on	 matters	 of	 substance	 is	 easier	 if	 you	 have	 earlier
 challenged	unfair	demands	on	process.

+ If	you	want	to	stand	firm	on	process,	it	is	best	to	(a)	demonstrate	that	you	seek	equality, not	 advantage,	 (b)	 acknowledge	 and	 address	 substantive	 concerns	 that	 are	 linked	 to process	choices,	and	(c)	negotiate	substance	in	parallel	with	process.

+ Early-stage	interactions	can	provide	a	relatively	low-cost	opportunity	to	shape	the	terms of	future	engagement.

+ Your	willingness	to	incur	up-front	costs	in	support	of	the	process	sends	a	credible	signal
 of	your	commitment	to	it.

+ Label	your	concessions.	Even	genuine	acts	of	kindness	and	wisdom	can	be	interpreted as	weakness	or	incompetence.	Shape	the	attributions	others	will	make	of	your	behavior	to ensure	that	you	encourage	reciprocity	rather	than	exploitation.

+ If	a	destructive	pattern	is	entrenched,	label	your	future	concessions.

+ Credibility	 is	 usually	 lost	 a	 little	 at	 a	 time.	 Safeguard	 your	 credibility	 by	 following through	on	your	commitments,	even	the	small	ones.

+ Empathy	expands	the	set	 of	options	you	 have	for	resolving	the	 conflict.	The	better	you
 understand	the	other	side’s	perspective,	the	more	likely	you	are	to	find	a	solution.

+ Create	 slack.	 If	 your	 calculus	 for	 retaliation	 ignores	 the	 possibility	 of	 mistakes	 or misunderstanding,	the	risk	of	unhealthy	and	inappropriate	escalation	increases.

+ There	 is	 almost	 always	 a	 trade-off	 between	 maintaining	 strategic	 flexibility	 and safeguarding	credibility.

+ Do	 not	 make	 ultimatums	 unless	 you	 plan	 to	 follow	 through	 on	 them—and	 even	 then, look	for	other	means	of	influence	that	won’t	sacrifice	strategic	flexibility.

+ Do	not	force	people	to	choose	between	doing	what	is	smart	and	doing	what	helps	them save	face.

+ Beware	 the	 curse	 of	 knowledge.	 Once	 we	 know	 something,	 we	 lose	 the	 ability	 to understand	what	it	feels	like	not	to	know	it.

+ Don’t	just	prepare	your	arguments,	prepare	your	audience	for	your	arguments.

+ Consider	 all	 potential	 explanations	 for	 the	 other	 side’s	 behavior.	 Do	 not	 start	 by assuming	incompetence	or	ill	intent.

+ Early,	 and	 throughout	 the	 negotiation,	 audit	 the	 psychological,	 structural,	 and	 tactical barriers	that	may	obstruct	deal	making.

+ Work	 the	 whole	 body.	 Consider	 all	 the	 barriers,	 approach	 the	 problem	 from	 all directions,	and	use	all	the	levers	at	your	disposal.

+ Ignore	 ultimatums.	 The	 more	 attention	 you	 give	 to	 them,	 the	 harder	 it	 will	 be	 for	 the other	side	to	back	down	if	the	situation	changes.

+ Reframe	ultimatums.	By	rephrasing	ultimatums	using	less	rigid	language,	you	make	it easier	for	the	other	side	to	back	down	later.

+ What	 is	 not	 negotiable	 today	 may	 be	 negotiable	 tomorrow.	 Think	 about	 how	 to	 shape incentives	 and	 options	 for	 all	 sides	 to	 make	 future	 attempts	 at	 negotiation	 more successful.

+ Ibn	 Saud	 decided	 that	 the	 only	 way	 to	 tackle	 religiously	 expressed	 objections	 would	 be	  through
religion	itself,	not	by	going	around	it.	So,	he	invited	a	group	of	religious	leaders	to	the	palace	and	asked
one	to	hold	a	microphone	while	another	was	asked	to	stand	at	the	receiving	end	of	the	technology.	He	then
asked	the	first	to	read	a	passage	from	the	Quran,	the	Muslim	holy	book.	As	the	voice	was	carried	over	to
the	speaker	on	the	other	end,	Ibn	Saud	made	the	argument	that	would	win	the	debate:	if	this	machine	were
the	work	of	the	devil,	how	could	it	possibly	carry	the	words	of	the	Quran?

+ Sometimes	the	best	response	to	a	deep-rooted	perspective	is	to	yield	to	it:	understand	it, adopt	it,	and	repurpose	it	to	advance	your	position.

+ Competing	 perspectives	 can	 be	 bridged	 if (a)	 one	 side	 can	 adopt	 the	 other’s	 frame
 without	sacrificing	their	ability	to	articulate	key	demands,	or	(b)	both	sides	can	agree	to	a
 new	frame	that	gives	neither	an	advantage.

+ Yielding	to	the	other	party’s	frame	or	perspective	might	enhance	your	leverage.

+ If	 your	 proposals	 are	 being	 rejected	 but	 their	 concerns	 seem	 legitimate,	 try	 giving	 the
 other	side	the	task	of	structuring	the	deal—but	clarify	the	conditions	they	must	meet.

+ Think	 trilaterally:	 evaluate	 how	 third	 parties	 influence	 or	 alter	 the	 interests,
 constraints,	and	alternatives	of	those	at	the	table.


+ Map	 out	 the	 negotiation	 space.	 Your	 strategy	 should	 take	 into	 account	 all	 parties	 who can	influence	the	deal	or	who	are	influenced	by	the	deal.

**ICAP	ANALYSIS:	INTERESTS,	CONSTRAINTS,	ALTERNATIVES,	AND	PERSPECTIVE**

+ **Interests:**	What	do	the	other	parties	value?	What	do	they	want	and	why?	What	are	their	relative
priorities?	Why	are	they	doing	this	deal?	Why	now	rather	than	last	month	or	next	year?	What	do	they
worry	 about?	 What	 objectives	 are	 they	 trying	 to	 achieve	 with	 this	 negotiation?	 Are	 their	 interests
likely	to	change	over	time?	If	so,	how?  

+ **Constraints:**	What	are	the	things	they	can	and	cannot	do?	On	which	issues	do	they	have	more	or
less	 flexibility?	 On	 which	 issues	 are	 their	 hands	 completely	 tied?	 What	 is	 causing	 them	 to	 be
constrained?	How	might	their	constraints	change	over	time?	Are	there	other	parties	with	whom	we
might	negotiate	on	their	side	who	would	be	less	constrained?  

+ **Alternatives:**	What	happens	to	them	if	there	is	no	deal?	Are	their	outside	options	strong	or	weak?
Are	 their	 alternatives	 likely	 to	 improve	 or	 deteriorate	 over	 time?	 How	 might	 their	 alternatives	 be
shaped?  

+ **Perspective:**	How	are	they	seeing	this	deal?	What	is	their	mind-set?	Where	does	this	negotiation
fit	into	the	portfolio	of	deals	they	are	doing?	Is	this	a	high	or	low	priority	for	them?	Are	they	thinking
strategically	 or	 tactically?	 Long-term	 or	 short-term?	 Is	 this	 negotiation	 occupying	 a	 large	 or	 small
portion	of	their	organization’s	attention?

+ When	 it	 comes	 to	 evaluating	 the	 action	 away	 from	 the	 table	 and	 how	 it	 can	 influence	 the
negotiation,	there	are	three	assessments	worth	making:
  * Static	Assessment:	How	does	the	 existence	of	third	parties	influence	the	interests,	constraints,	alternatives,	and	perspectives	of	all parties	in	the	negotiation?
  * Dynamic	Assessment:	 How	 is	 third-party	 influence	  changing	 over	 time?	 That	 is,	 are	 the	 other	 side’s	 alternatives	 improving	 or worsening?	Are	constraints	tightening	or	loosening?	Are	interests	evolving?
  * Strategic	Assessment:	How	might	we	engage	with	third	parties	to	 influence	the	negotiation?	Might	they	be	willing	to	put	pressure on	 the	 other	 side?	 Might	 they	 agree	 to	 subsidize	 the	 deal?	 Would	 doing	 a	 deal	 with	 a	 third	 party	 change	 the	 power	 dynamics	 in	 our favor?

+ Prepare	for	good	fortune.	Be	psychologically,	organizationally,	and	politically	prepared in	case	a	window	of	opportunity	opens	for	deal	making	or	diplomacy.

+ When	 there	 is	 no	 possibility	 of	 reaching	 a	 deal	 today,	 prepare	 for	 future	 opportunities with	moves	that	improve	positioning	and	create	option	value.

+ Avoid	 picking	 a	 winning	 strategy	 earlier	 than	 is	 necessary.	 Keep	 options	 open	 and	 be prepared—psychologically,	organizationally,	and	politically—to	change	course.

+ See	the	other	side	as	your	partner,	not	your	opponent,	regardless	of	the	type	or	degree	of conflict.	It	is	hard	to	empathize	or	collaborate	with	“opponents.”

+ Start	 by	 asking:	 What	 would	 be	 the	 value-maximizing	 outcome?	 Are	 there	 ways	 to create	value?

+ Protracted	conflicts	cannot	be	resolved	without	genuine	efforts	to	understand	the	deep-seated	forces	that	legitimize	each	side’s	perspective	and	behavior.

+ Understand	what	is	sacred	to	the	other	side	and	avoid	asking	for	it	as	a	precondition	to engagement.	They	might	agree	to	negotiate	what	was	once	nonnegotiable,	but	only	if	they see	a	credible	path	to	resolving	the	conflict	or	achieving	vital	objectives.

+ History	 begins	 at	 different	 times	 for	 different	 people.	 The	 dates	 that	 register	 on	 our calendars	are	typically	those	that	mark	our	victories	and	victimizations.

+ Asking	people	to	forget	the	past	is	futile,	but	it	is	sometimes	possible	to	help	them	find more	value-creating	ways	to	apply	the	lessons	of	the	past.

+ What	we	usually	consider	as	impossible	are	simply	engineering	problems—there’s no	law	of	physics	preventing	them.
