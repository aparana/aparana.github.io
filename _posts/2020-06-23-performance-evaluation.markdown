title:  "[Career Growth] Performance evaluation"

---

I think there are 4 ways to measure the performance of a product manager.

- [OKRs](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/) - If a manager is leading an org then it is critical she gets the right goals and meets most of them. Is her organisation fulfilling the delivery expectations?
- [Core skills](https://snowflake.medium.com/#1,2,3,2,4,1,1,4,3,2,0,4,2,2,3,0,Cersei%20Lannister,Senior%20Group%20Lead) - How does she rate when it comes to core skills?
- [Org level expectations](https://www.sachinrekhi.com/product-management-career-ladders-at-8-top-technology-firms) -  Is she meeting the requirements for the level she is in the org ladder? If she is a senior manager is she meeting the requirements set for that role?
- [360 review](https://support.reflektive.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000578686-Preparing-for-a-Review) - Is she meeting the goals for her as well as her organisation but also meeting them in the right way? Meeting her  org level expectations as well as delivering on her team's OKRs does not matter if she is alienating her team and half of the team is on the verge of quitting. What is her review from peers, manager, reports?
