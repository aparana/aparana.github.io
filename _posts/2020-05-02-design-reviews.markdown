title:  "[Design] Creation Process and Reviews"
---

We like involving Design as early as we can in the product development process. As soon as the first draft of the spec is done, We get Design and Dev involved through a Kick off meeting which explains the problem statement we are tackling, the WHY behind a feature. After the WHY is explained, we start brainstorming on Design


**Here is how our typical design process looks like**

- PM shares the [product spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sUX-sm5qZ474PCQQUpvdi3lvvmWPluqHOyfXz3xKL2M/edit#heading=h.b2fqwtvw6ni5)
- PM brainstorms with Designer
- PM explains product principles
- PM and Design come up with design principles
- PM explains the prioritisation order for the problems he/she wants Design help
- Design works on the wireframes, mostly low fidelity, based on the priority order
- Designer starts working on the design spec
- Design review is set up for this project
- Feedback is shared and added as MOM to the spec, and also shared on the Slack channel for the project
- Designer and PM works on the feedback collected
- Designer shares the first cut wireframes with more designers in their weekly design review, which involves not just this project but other projects that designers in the Org are working currently on
- Additional feedback is collected and incorporated
- Devs and QAs are also part of the design reviews from the beginning
- So we avoid bringing unrealistic specs as well as designs to devs. By unrealistic I meant designs which will take months to build. We discuss alternate ways we can solve the problem. We see if there can be any any scope cut: things which can be pushed to later milestones or just removed from the requirements
- After multiple iterations, and multiple design reviews the wireframes are frozen
- Now that the happy flow is clear we start focusing on the edge cases. Also errors
- One these are done, we send the designs to a central IXD team which help us get the final high fidelity designs
- Designs are uploaded on [Abstract](https://www.abstract.com/) and the link is shared with Devs
