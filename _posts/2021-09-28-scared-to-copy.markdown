title:  "Scared to copy"
---

There is this weird thing with designers. They really feel that just because a particular interaction has been pioneered by a competitor, they can't reuse it in their flows.

A typical conversation with a designer: Why did you put this particular interaction? This doesn't seem good for the user. Why did we use this vs X?

Their response: Oh but this competitor already has done X. How can we copy them? This really makes me upset.

What we have to understand as product builders is that what wins in the market is not the most original and innovative design: be it UI elements or specific interactions. What wins is the combination of these two that does the job well for the users who will get their hands on our product. We don't need to compromise usability over originality. Let's just do what's best for our user.

And the worst is when a designer or a PM tries to be original and then does not think through all the edge cases. Then we have a feature that is not well thought out and the user ends up suffering. Say you are launching a video conferencing tool. To sell it when a competitor like Zoom exists you have to think how can you make it much much better than Zoom. You can choose better security or decentralisation or lower memory usage or lower bandwidth usage. You can target a different market. Change positioning. Does it really matter where you place the buttons for the tool? I dare say it does not. Just fucking copy the interface and optimise on one dimension that will let you win. Don't try to solve interaction problems already solved by Zoom.

Your users will thank you for solving their problem. Not for being original.
