title:  "The simplest narrative"
---

One hypothesis I am tracking closely: Does the simplest narrative win?

Example. Bitcoin's narrative is very simple. No one thinks that it will ever be a viable currency due to its scalability issues. So it's narrative, that has not changed for the last few years, is that it is a replacement for gold as a store of value.

As long as enough people replace gold with bitcoin or buy bitcoin, which will happen more and more as third world countries suffer from authoritarian governments, we will see bitcoin hold its value.

Again, note that I am talking about storage of value and not growth of value. No one expects their gold price to swing much. People are holding gold for value protection and not for crazy returns.

Now compare it with other projects in the world of crypto. Etherium is skyrocketing in popularity because the use cases on Etherium have gone up in recent times. Everyone is talking about the possibilities with Etherium: NFT, Defi, Metaverse. As long as people care about even one of these use cases and that use case grows, the value of Eth will keep growing up. Take all the new NFT holders for example.

But say what if 5 years down the line the narrative changes from Etherium is secure and decentralised and hence it is not great to it is not scalable. What if people start thinking that decentralisation does not matter as much as scalability. Then you can argue that Solana with having 1000 validators but far higher scalability (50,000 transactions per second) and cheaper transaction fees is better than Etherium.

What if the dev ecosystem and along with NFT and Defi users move from Etherium to Solana. Will the value of etherium erode? Will its price crash?

As more and more use cases come and go, the narrative becomes more complex. Etherium's narrative is far more complex than Bitcoin's. It can be a good thing or bad. Only time will tell.
