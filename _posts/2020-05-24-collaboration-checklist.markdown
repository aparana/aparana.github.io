title:  "[Project Management] Best practices for cross-team collaboration"

---

- Define [DACI](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/daci), milestones and project scopes clearly but anticipate changes along the way.
- Decider is the most important stakeholder you need to identify in DACI.
- Make sure ownership of the project is clear from day 1.
- There are 2 kinds of goals: primary and secondary. Primary is the one you need to achieve to make the project a success. Secondary are the 'nice to haves'. Identify the primary and secondary metrics which are doing to tell you whether you have achieved your goals.
- Most of the flux around scoping, timelines come because people are unclear what the actual primary goal is.
- Define roll out strategy early in the project.
- Plan ahead for hand/take over of the project.
- Communicate actively via all mediums (i.e. Slack, Email, documentations etc).
- - Communicate better with visual aids if possible.
- Centralise your documentation and use it actively.
- Loop in PMs, TLs from dependent teams early instead of sending FYI mails at the last minute
- If you have got commitment from them, then send out a mail with
  - Owner for each task
  - Timeline
  - Status
- Frequently send out updates, highlighting dependencies, so that these are resolved before codefreeze
- Sending out a mail or slack does not mean commitment from the other team. Make sure the commitments are acknowledged on mail/slack
- Link to the relevant discussions you have had with external stakeholders in your update mails/slack comments. Also add these to your MOM section in the spec   
- A taskâ€™s status should be one of these:
  - Yet to be picked
  - In progress
  - Done
  - Delayed
  - At-Risk
- Involve key stakeholders and ensure they are held responsible.
- Avoid last-minute surprises. If you hate last-minute bad news as a manager, then avoid giving the same to your manager too.
- Keep giving frequent updates so that blockers are highlighted much before they delay your project.
- Escalate blockers early. Also share good news early, if any, to motivate the team.
- In case a project fails, make sure you highlight both the good and the bad. Most people focus only on the bad. Write a post-mortem report with learnings, and share the next steps.
