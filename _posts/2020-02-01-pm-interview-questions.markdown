**User behavior:**

You are the PM of Bounce. You see a lot of first time users not taking caring of the bikes they have rented. If you have to create a carrot and stick program to improve behavior what would it look like?

**Onboarding/First time user experience:**

You are the PM of Pratilipi. How will you design the first time user experience for writers to get them writing/publishing in their first session itself?

How will you use gamification (maybe create streaks etc) for increasing number of users who share content?

**New product:**

What will be the changes in the product to do this upsell?

**New product/ Business case:**

You are the PM for new initiatives at Bookmyshow. Your CEO has asked you to create a playo clone for booking sports activities because in his mind booking activities is similar to booking events
