title:  "The small things"

---

Earlier if you accidentally removed your headphones from phone/ laptop, your music would not pause and all of your coworkers would suddenly hear your playlist. It used to be super awkward

Then some PM/Designer decided it should not be the case

Earlier you would open multiple tabs on your laptop and suddenly some popup ad video on one of these tabs would start playing before you get to pause it. You would frantically search for the culprit

Then someone decided to put a speaker icon on the tab and make our lives easy

Earlier you would keep talking on your microphone not realising you are on mute

Then Zoom decided to tell you to unmute yourself

Earlier all meetings would have video and audio on by default

Then Zoom decided you could choose to turn off your video before a call
and
You need not frantically try to locate the webcam to cover it

Earlier you would switch back and forth between browser/app to messages app in order to find out and add verification SMS code

Then someone decided to extract verification code from the SMS and put it right above the keyboard. Tap, add, verify

Earlier you had to switch to a calendar app when replying to an email for a confirmed meeting time

Until someone at thought of better approach: Convert to event

It is small things like these which gets me excited about product design

You don't have to do anything revolutionary as a PM or designer. Just think about the small improvements which can bring outsized delight to your customers
