title:  "Left or Right"

---

I find it interesting that people who identify themselves as from the left or right, have the exact same positions as their tribe on everything from economics, religion, politics to who is the latest person who should get cancelled. It is almost as if they are incapable of independent thinking.

This is the reason I avoid labels. As PG rightly says: [The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you.](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html)
