title:  "Dear beginner PM, Say YES"

---

Something I recommend to all new PMs: Say Yes to as many projects as you can at the beginning of your PM career. It will stretch you thin but help you learn at a much higher rate than your peers. Note: This can be a piece of advice for PMs joining a new company too.

I have always followed this advice ever since I became a PM 6 years back. Even before I could understand what a PM does, I was tasked with launching a new Business unit for CouponDunia. I learned 10X of what a new PM learns in the 3 months we took to launch Cashboss. And I have followed this advice throughout my career.

2 years back I was told to plan and launch the entire safety roadmap of Gojek inside 2 months of joining. I had no idea about how Transport worked, forget the streams I was asked to lead: Payments, Convenience, and Safety. I said Yes not just to creating a Safety stream, but also incubated dedicated Convenience and Payments teams inside Transport. After 6 months when these teams were more stable, my boss told me to work on our ride booking process. We launched a completely revamped booking flow over the next few months. All this growth happened because I kept saying Yes to whatever interesting opportunities came my way.

So say YES more. That is the only way to learn more in a small timeframe.
