**This is a draft**

The book tells about some of the practices used by the HFTs - 

For example, HFTs tried to set up their computers closest to the exchange to front-run the orders. If there are 10 exchanges and I want to buy 500 shares of X, let us say that the first order goes to exchange 1 and was fulfilled. By the time, the orders went to farther away exchanges, the price of X would have shot up. This was because HFTs would have bought shares of X and were selling them later at higher prices. All this difference is few microseconds. 
To solve such issues, Brad and team (Allen, Roba and others) built THOR. 

Further, the wall street banks had set up their own dark pools. If a big investor wants to buy million shares, she would not want to sent it to public exchange and hence came the concept of dark pools. 
It is assumed that prop desks within these banks used to sell to these investors at much higher price. 
Currently, dark pools are not allowed. 

Lastly, exchanges like BAST paid takers instead of makers so that the HFTs could get the information. And then there was the rule that the order should be fulfiled by the cheapest exchange. 
Finally Brad and team decided to set up their own exchange called IEX.

Quotes- 
> “Russians had a reputation for being the best programmers on Wall Street, and Serge thought he knew why: They had been forced to learn to program computers without the luxury of endless computer time. Many years later, when he had plenty of computer time, Serge still wrote out new programs on paper before typing them into the machine. “In Russia, time on the computer was measured in minutes,” he said. “When you write a program, you are given a tiny time slot to make it work.”
