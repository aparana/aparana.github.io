So we have the entity now - Next is the ownership pie.
During or after the incorporation, you should also set up an agreement to document some of the important aspects of the relationship among the co-founders. (Founders' agreement)

One of the most important provisions of this agreement is specifying the equity ownership of each of the co-founders of the company.

I am assuming that you would want to split (almost) equally. If that's not the case, please consider the following points -
- Equity is intended to provide "long-term" incentives and so you would want your co-founder(s) to be as or more motivated.
- It is more about execution than coming up with some idea.
- Investors will look at the split and if it is too uneven you should have a strong justification.
Lastly, consider the journey as a marathon rather than a sprint, and your co-founders will be your best friends soon.

You can and should have **vesting of the shares** (to handle the unlikely case of one of the founders exiting the startup).
Usually, the vesting is time-based (have heard about milestone-based as well), with a standard 1-year cliff. The usual practice is 4-year vesting (considering it takes longer to go public you can extend it to 5-7 years). At the end of one year, you get 25% of your share, and then the rest 75% share can be distributed monthly or again yearly over the next three years.

I will discuss other clauses that you can add to handle the unfortunate case of the co-founder leaving the company in the next post.

Usual Disclaimer: All views expressed are my own as some readings recommend not splitting equally.
