I have considered myself an atheist since I was a kid. I was the kind of annoying kid who would look forward to arguments on whether God exists. My dad tried his best to take me to the nearby temples but gave up soon. But as I grew up I noticed something, which is best captured in this excerpt from [Chetan Bhagat's The 3 Mistakes of My Life]((https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3320520-the-3-mistakes-of-my-life)). I remember reading this as a teenager and going "Hmm..I have noticed the same. The people who are religious and believe that there is a supreme being who created this universe but cares about their food habits might be naive, but at least they seem peaceful. So what is more important: The truth or the fact that the person seems peaceful knowing that there is a supreme being who is going to always watch over them"

This is not just about religion. In my pursuit of truth, I have always wondered if I am better of knowing it. Example: If I knew there was a best friend who gossips about me, whether I will feel happy knowing that, or was I better off not knowing that information
