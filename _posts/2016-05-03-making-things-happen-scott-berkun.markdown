**Note:** While reading a book whenever I come across something interesting, I highlight it on my Kindle. Later I turn those highlights into a blogpost. It is not a complete summary of the book. These are my notes which I intend to go back to later. Let's start!

+ The Boeing Company, one of the largest airplane design and engineering firms in the world, keeps a black book
of lessons it has learned from design and engineering
failures.

+ A forcing function is anything that—when put in
place—naturally forces a change in perspective, attitude, or behavior.
So, schedules are important forcing functions for projects. If used
properly by a PM, schedules force everyone to carefully think through
the work they need to do.

+ Here's how the rule of thirds works. Break the available time
into three parts—one for design, one for implementation, and one for
testing.

+ A big project should be a sequence of smaller
projects, all using rule of thirds

+ Milestone length should match
project volatility. The more change that is expected,
the shorter the milestones should be. Small milestones set the
team up for easier mid-game adjustments

+ Be optimistic in the vision and skeptical in the schedule

+ Plan checkpoints for add/cut discussions

+ Take on risks early. If you know that Sally has the most complex component, deal with
those challenges up front in the schedule. The bigger the risk,
the more time you'll want on your side in dealing with it

+ All estimates are probabilities. Because schedules are a
collection of estimates, they are also probabilities. This works
against schedule accuracy because probabilities accumulate
(80%×80% = 64%).

+ Most planning frustrations occur when there's disagreement
or ignorance about these issues.
  + Who has requirements
authority? Someone has to define the requirements and
get them approved by the necessary parties (client or VP).
  + Who has design authority? Similar to requirements, someone has to
define the design of the work itself.
  + Who has technical
authority? Technical authority is defined by who gets
to choose which engineering approaches are used, including
programming languages, development tools, and technical
architecture
  + Who has budget
authority? The ability to add or remove resources to
a project can be independent from other kinds of authority


  + How often will requirements and
designs be reviewed, and how will adjustments be
decided? The answer depends heavily on previous
questions.

+ **Documents required**:

  + Marketing requirements document
(MRD). This is the business or marketing team's
analysis of the world.
  + Vision/scope document.
A vision document encapsulates all available thinking about what
a project might be into a single composition. If an MRD exists,
a vision document should inherit and refer heavily to it.
  + Specifications. These
capture what the end result of the work should be for one part
of the project. Good specifications are born from a set of
requirements
  + Work breakdown structure
(WBS). While a specification details the work to be
done, a WBS defines how a team of engineers will go about doing
it. What work will be done first? Who will do it? What are all
of the individual pieces of work and how can we track them?


+ **A good business perspective means that the team has answers
for the following questions**:
  + Why is this project needed for our business?
  + What unmet needs or desires do our customers have?
  + What features or services might we provide that will meet those desires and needs?
  + On what basis will customers purchase this product or
service?
  + What will motivate them to do so?What will it cost (people/resources)? Over what time period?
  + What potential for revenue (or reduced organizational
operating costs) does it have? Over what time period?
  + What won't we build so that we can build this?
  + Will it contribute to our long-term business strategy or
protect other revenue-generating assets? (Even nonprofits or IT
organizations have a business strategy: there are always bills
to pay, revenue to obtain, or revenue-generating groups to
support.)
  + How will this help us match, outflank, or beat
competitors?
  + What are the market time windows that we should target for
this project?

+ A requirement by definition is anything the
team (and client) agrees will be satisfied when the project is
completed

+ Create an open-issues list to track questions that need to
be resolved before specifications can be completed.

+ Specs should do three things: ensure that the right product
gets built, provide a schedule milestone that concludes a planning
phase of a project, and enable deep review and feedback from
different individuals over the course of the project.

+ Good specs simplify. They are primarily a form of
communication.

+ Specifying is very different from designing. There should be clear authority for who writes and has
control over the spec.Closing the gap is one approach to managing open issues and
to accelerate the end of the specification process.A review process is the simplest way to define and control
spec quality.

+ Singular evaluation makes sense for situations where the
difference between a great solution and a decent solution isn't
important. Klein describes these situations as being in the zone of
indifference because the decision maker is indifferent to major
aspects of the outcome as long as a basic criterion is met

+ Good decision makers don't waste time optimizing things that don't
need to be optimized. As Tyler Durden says, "That which doesn't matter
truly should not matter."

+ Comparative evaluation is best for complex situations that
involve many variables, have consequences that are difficult to grasp
quickly, or require a high quality outcome. New situations or problems
that are strategic in nature are prime candidates for comparative
evaluation. The more that is at stake in a decision, and the less
familiar everyone is with the nature of the options, the more
appropriate a comparative evaluation is. With teams, comparative
evaluation is the best framework to use if you have to convince others
or want their participation in the decision-making process.
Comparative evaluation forces you to make relative arguments and
develop deeper rationales for action, which is useful for group
discussion and communication.

+ **Good email should**:
  + Be concise, simple, and
direct.
  + Offer an action and a
deadline
  + Avoid giving a
play-by-play.

+ **Never reprimand in real time.** The worst thing in the world, especially during a crisis, is
for a manager or leader to reprimand someone while the issue is
still unresolved. It solves nothing, and it minimizes the
probability that the problem will be solved because the person who
knows the most about the issue (the blamed) is made to feel guilty
and defensive.

+ **Trust is built through effective commitments.** Trust is lost through inconsistent behavior on matters of
importance.Use the granting of authority and trust to enable people to
do great work.Granted power comes from the organizational hierarchy.
Earned power comes only from people's responses to your actions.
Earned power is more useful than granted power, although both are
necessary.Use delegation to build trust on your team and to ensure
your team against adversity.Respond to problems in a way that will maintain people's
trust. Support them during crises so that they bring issues to you
instead of hiding them.

+ Every engineering work item
should map to a feature, and every feature should map to a goal. If
a new work item is added, it must be matched against features and
goals.

+ **Buy people coffee and tasty
things.** This sounds stupid, but I've found that
people I've argued with for days on end are somehow more
receptive over a nice cup of coffee at a local coffee shop.
Change the dynamic of the relationship: no matter how much you
like or don't like the person, make the invitation and invest
the 20 seconds of effort it requires

+ **Everything can be represented in an ordered list.** Most of
the work of project management is correctly prioritizing things
and leading the team in carrying them out.The three most basic ordered lists are: project goals
(vision), list of features, and list of work items. They should
always be in sync with each other. Each work item contributes to a
feature, and each feature contributes to a goal.There is a bright yellow line between priority 1 work and
everything else.Things happen when you say no. If you can't say no, you
effectively have no priorities.The PM has to keep the team honest and close to
reality.Knowing the critical path in engineering and team processes
enables efficiency.You must be both relentless and savvy to make things
happen.

+ Mid-game and end-game correspond to the middle and end of
the project. If on any day the project is not going well, it's your job
to figure out what's wrong and resolve it. Repeat this throughout
mid-game.Projects are complex non-linear systems and have significant
inertia. If you wait to see acute problems before taking action,
you will be too late and may make things worse.When your project is out of control, you are flying behind
the plane, which is a bad place to be. Sanity checking is the
easiest way to stay in front of the plane. There are both tactical
and strategic sanity checks.Consider how to take action to correct a situation in the
safest way possible. The larger the action, and the further along
the project is, the more dangerous the actions are.The coding pipeline is how work items are managed during
implementation. There are aggressive and conservative ways to
manage the pipeline.Milestone-based planning and the coding pipeline provide
opportunities to make safe course corrections for projects.Change control (DCRs) is how you throttle the rate of
medium- and low-level change on a project.

+ **Big deadlines are a series of small deadlines.** Any milestone has three smaller deadlines: design complete
(specs finished), feature complete (implementation finished), and
milestone complete (quality assurance and refinement
finished).Defining exit criteria at the beginning of milestones
improves the team's ability to hit its dates.Hitting dates is like landing airplanes: you need a long,
slow approach. And you want to be ready to take off again quickly,
without having to do major repairs.You need elements of measurement to track the project.
Common elements include daily builds, bug management, and the
activity chart.You need elements of control to project level adjustments.
Common elements of control include review meetings, triage, and
war team.The end of end-game is a slow, mind-numbing process. The
challenge is to narrow the scope of changes until a satisfactory
release remains.Now is the time to start the postmortem process. Give
yourself and your team the benefit of learning from what went well
and what didn't.If fortune shines on you, and your project makes it out the
door, be happy. Very, very happy. Many people, through no fault of
their own, never get that far. Plan a grand night. Do ridiculously
fun and extravagant things (including inviting this author to the
party). Give yourself stories to tell for years to come.

+ Instead of saying "I need another programmer,"
understand that you can honestly say, "To achieve goals X and Y,
my team needs another programmer. Our project plan didn't
anticipate the three requests that came in last week, and as a
result, our goals are currently at high risk."

+ **Politics are a natural consequence of human nature.** When
people work together in groups, there is a limited amount of
authority, which must be distributed across different people with
different desires and motivations.All leaders have political constraints. Every executive,
CEO, or president has peers or superiors who limit their ability
to make decisions. In general, the more power a person has, the
more complex the constraints are that they must work
within.There are many different kinds of political power, including
rewards, coercion, knowledge, referent, and influence.Power is misused when it's applied in ways that do not serve
the project goals. A lack of clarity around goals, unclear
resource allocation or decision-making processes, or
misunderstandings can contribute to the misuse of power.To solve political problems, clarify what you need. Identify
who has it, and then assess how you might be able to get
it.If you are involved in project management, you are defining
a political playing field around you. It's up to you to decide how
fair or insane it is.
