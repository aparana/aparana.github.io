title:  "Happiest man"
---

*I think* the happiest person in the world is probably someone living in some tier 3 city, has a good relationship with his family, does not even know what startups are, has a job at some bank or something, comes back to his home on time, and gets a good night sleep. He does not care about Silicon Valley CTCs on Blind and has not even discovered Twitter yet.


When I was in my early 20s, I used to get on a sleeper bus and just travel somewhere. Anywhere. The best part of the journey was seldom the destination. It was lying on the bus bed, looking outside and passing endless small towns and villages. I used to wonder how life might be in those sleepy villages. Was it peaceful or were they also running on some hedonic treadmill? Maybe I was romanticizing the whole thing. Maybe it was just escapism. Finally, I realized I could never stay in a place without fiber optic internet and my dream of small-town Manas ended. But I still think sometimes "what if". Not for a long time but why not try that life for a month, if not a year.

Maybe someday. Thanks for reading.Â
