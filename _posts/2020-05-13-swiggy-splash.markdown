title:  "Swiggy's new splash screen"

Absolutely ❤️ Swiggy's new splash screen. It shows you the location they have picked from your device; which means that you won't be wasting time in case they picked a stale location. I am sure ordering from the wrong location by mistake was one of their top 10 customer support issues.

Avoiding errors before users can make them should be a design goal. And this is one way of doing that. Hats off to Swiggy's design team. This is such an elegant fix.
