title:  "Vision vs Winning"
---

Instead of a fancy 'vision statement', leaders would be far better of defining what 'winning' for their company looks like

Vision statements are generally abstract. Mostly written as a checklist item

While winning criteria is far more concrete: Gaining 50% market share or IPO'ing by X date

Ask yourself the following questions:

1. What game your company is playing?
2. How will you know that you have won?

I am pretty sure 90% of us will fail to answer this. And that my friend is a tragedy
