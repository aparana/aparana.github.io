title:  "How do we get people to start taking rides again?"
---

If you are a strategy/product person working in the on-demand sector, instead of asking what would it take for users to start taking rides/ordering food again, just ask yourself what would it take for you to do the same. I keep seeing useless ideation sessions, strategy sync-ups, but no one ever asks this simple question during these meetings.

If you can't convince yourself to take a ride during this pandemic, how will you convince others to do the same?
