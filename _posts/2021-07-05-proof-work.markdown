One interesting trend I am observing: Proof of work.

Here is a guy who sends a newsletter on how he would grow various products: [Andrea's zerotomarketing](https://www.zerotomarketing.com/). Another wrote a thread on [marketing every day for a month](https://twitter.com/alexgarcia_atx/status/1382870721458675714). There are many more examples that you will find online.

Want to get a job as a product manager in a startup without any experience?

Write about the onboarding experience of 30 products (either threads or blogposts). One every day. Then reach out to the founder of a startup and tell them that you will solve their onboarding. It is far better than DM'ing people and asking if they have an opening.

I practice what I preach: [How I became a product manager.](https://manassaloi.com/2018/03/30/how-i-became-pm.html)
