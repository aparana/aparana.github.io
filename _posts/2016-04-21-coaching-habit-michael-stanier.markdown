**This blogpost is not an exhaustive summary of the book. Just contains the notes I took**  

This book is regarding how to provide coaching and conduct successful one on ones. The 7 questions you are supposed to ask are:

* What is on your mind?
* And what else?
* What is the real challenge for you?
* What do you want?
* What do you want from me?/ How can I help?
* What are you saying No to?
* What was most useful for you about this conversation?
