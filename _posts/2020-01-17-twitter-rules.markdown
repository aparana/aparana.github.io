title:  "Twitter Rules"

---

I like writing rules for myself. The idea of organising my thoughts on any topic in a structured way gets me excited. So it was inevitable I would create this post

**Here are my Twitter rules:**

- Write a blogpost about things people have asked at least a dozen times so that you can link to the post instead of having to answer the question again

- Don't tag people on your tweets unless it is really important

- Don't seek attention. Don't post controversial things for the sake of engagement

- Don't be a groupie (By groupie I mean an enthusiastic or uncritical follower of someone on Twitter)

- Horizontal relationships vs vertical be it on social media or real life. Read the courage to be disliked to know more about this concept

- Back scratching is at the core of the Twitter experience. I see people tag each other on 'Who is the best in X' tweets. Like/retweet each other for mutual benefit. I don't want that. Like my tweets if it is something worth liking. Not because I did the same for you
 - A little background: When I was young I used to run all sort of experiments on social media. I would like someone's post/photo before sharing my own. And I found a super high correlation between me liking someone's post following by them liking mine. I stopped believing in social media relationships quite early thanks to my early experience

- Don't change your Twitter activity based on how many followers you have
 - A little background: Years back I used to be minor [Quora celeb](https://www.quora.com/search?q=manas+saloi) (forgive me for calling myself that). I probably had one of the highest Upvote/Answer count of Quora writers. Anything I used to write would blow up. And as I gained followers, started gaining prominence in the platform I started getting followed by other prominent/famous folks (startup founders, other top writers etc). Basically from people who mattered on Quora. The flip side of that was that I started getting paranoid about losing my top followers. I started only sharing the 'best content possible'. A strategy post I had written on Indian politics got viral during that period. In spite of me not being that into Politics I started wondering if I should write more longer 'think pieces on politics' because a few of political analysts had followed me after that post. I started writing less of what I wanted and more of what would make me seem smart amongst my new 'famous' followers. I used to write a lot of joke answers (the version of shit posting on Quora) but I stopped that too. I eventually overcame this phase. And by the time I was done I realised I no longer enjoyed writing on Quora. Giving life advice to 15 year olds loses its appeal after a while. But promised myself that I would never change my writing style or content to impress people. If people like what I write (be it PM content or shit posts) they would follow. If they don't they can always fuck off
 - I see a lot of VCs, startup founders follow me on Twitter nowadays. Unlike half a decade back I don't worry about them  unfollowing me because of my shit posts. I have stopped caring basically.  I joke. I shitpost. I vent. Sometimes I post good stuff too. But it is my choice and not of people who followed me  

- Don't separate Manas the PM from Manas the shit poster. Social media should be a reflection of your entire persona and not a curated version of you.

- Don't reply to questions (either on replies or DM) which can be easily answered through a simple Google search

- Don't reply to Hi/Hello messages which don't have any context attached

- [Make people work for the help they seek](https://feld.com/archives/2014/12/identify-leaders-giving-people-assignments.html).
50% of these people don't even acknowledge my message because it involves an ask from me. But I get pleasantly surprised when someone actually reads the posts mentioned in the link and comes back with follow up questions

- Don't tie your ego to your Twitter profile. Or the number of followers, likes, retweets and other vanity metrics
 - A little background: Long back when I used to be a minor Quora celeb (wow Manas, stop with the Quora stories already. we get you were popular right?) it used to make me super happy seeing my answers get thousands of upvotes, hundred thousand+ page views. I used to track these numbers obsessively, and get super happy with myself. Then one day I stopped getting excited about them. I realised the meaningless of it all
 - If I am deleting my posts anyway in X days, I know I won't be looking for cheap ways for engagement. Or care about likes or retweets. The dopamine hits with each retweet is temporary. They give happiness in the short-term but like most things do not matter in the long run. I also don't have any tracking/analytics on this site. I don't want to know how many people are reading this
 - Does likes and retweets do not matter at all? I guess they do matter at some level. If no one is interacting with my tweets, I won't even know if anyone is reading them. And if no one was reading my tweets or blogposts I would not publish them. What I was merely pointing out was more around the meaningless of social media metrics than the usefulness of interactions
 - Deleting my tweets lets me be more honest. If I knew all my tweets would be stored for eternity I would not probably shit post about the Government. I don't want to go to jail for my anti BJP rants
 - My tweets being ephemeral almost lets my profile be a reflection of who I am at the current. Feelings change. Opinions change. I don't want to be tied to my tweets or my opinion. I probably cringe at most of my teenage facebook posts. I don't want some asshole going through my tweets from 5 years back and taking screenshots (which has happened in the past with facebook)
 - But I do turn interesting long threads into blogposts if I think people found them useful and refer to later

- Don't argue with people online. No one will change their views based on a single tweet. So why put in the efforts

- Don't write pointless replies like 'Disagree', 'Don't think so' on other people's tweets. They probably don't care about my opinion anyway. What would you get by posting 'Disagree' anyway?

- Don't retweet your own tweets
 - If I feel like I had posted something earlier which will be interesting for people who did not manage to read it the first time, I post the same tweet again
 - But then again let's accept that it is harder to retweet your tweets when they go away in a week. Another argument for deleting your tweets ;)

- Don't respond to Twitter replies unless there is something valuable to add

- You have free right to post snarky replies if you are in a bad mood though and someone had replied to your tweet with something stupid or unhelpful like 'Disagree'

- If you disagree with these rules, just know that these are mine and not yours. I probably don't care about your opinion anyway
