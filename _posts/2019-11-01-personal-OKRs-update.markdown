I have been sharing my goals publicly for quite some time now

^ Since I deleted most of my content on Quora a screenshot is all I have. I think I wrote this in the beginning of 2015, outlining my goals for the year

Some people feel that sharing your goals lead to a feeling of accomplishment and you drop the ball on them. I have had the opposite experience. Holding myself accountable publicly has always helped me stay focused and achieve my goals. Keeping that in mind I shared my personal OKRs on Twitter during the beginning of the year. The tweet got quite popular and a lot of people shared their OKRs with me and kept updating their own progress over time, example [this one by Nirant around Finance](https://twitter.com/NirantK/status/1189882367860707331)


Without further ado, here are the Objectives I set for myself this year and progress on each of the KRs
