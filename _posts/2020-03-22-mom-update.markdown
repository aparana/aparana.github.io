title:  "[MOM] How to write a MOM the right way"

---

Please find the MOM template here: [Emoji Reactions on Twitter Messages Update](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FK4Em8oWPfzR6hZcLWyNwhs1xDBTlAKfkaQvBB8MR-w/edit?usp=sharing).

Working in a big org helps you learn how to be better with communication.

I had written how to write a good product spec here: [Emoji Reactions on Twitter Messages](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sUX-sm5qZ474PCQQUpvdi3lvvmWPluqHOyfXz3xKL2M/edit).

This is another post written in the same vein. I hope you can use this to collaborate better with stakeholders in your company.


**Note:**
+ If you follow this format, you will find it far easier to collaborate with external stakeholders.
+ A good MOM is not just about the MOM, it lets you start a mail thread, where you can keep posting follow on updates.
