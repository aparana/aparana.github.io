How to plan a project (Steps):

(The WHY)
- Problem statement
- Gather data (qualitative or quantitative) that backs it

(The WHAT)
- Solution/milestone/ MVP to tackle the problem
- Milestone details with a timeline
- Success metrics/ how do you know if your project was successful?

(The HOW)
- Tech and Design specs with Implementation details
- Acceptance criteria
- Release plan

Most beginner PMs jump to the HOW directly without spending effort on the WHY and freezing the WHAT. When their CEO has second thoughts about the ROI of the project and gets it killed, these PMs crib about organizational politics.

Your job as a PM is to Focus on all 3. Don't pick up a new project just because your CEO asked you to. First be convinved yourself. If you are just running after developers doing what your CEO is asking you to do, you are just a glorified project manager. Sorry.

Please do your homework.
