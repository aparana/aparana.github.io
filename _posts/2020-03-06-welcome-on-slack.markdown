title: "Automated welcome message on Slack"

---

A PM in our company has set up a welcome bot message for anyone who joins her project channel on Slack. I am planning to add this to my product development workflow too

As we move towards an increasingly remote world, and start relying more on Slack, these small things will help a lot in improving collaboration IMHO
