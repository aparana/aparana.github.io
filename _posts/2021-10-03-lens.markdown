Lens is a framework to identify metrics that can help answer the following questions:

1. Are we growing?
2. Are we delivering value?
3. Are our customers happy?
4. Are our customers willing to pay?

Here is Lens being used for Urban Company, a top home services provided marketplace in India. I have done it for both demand and supply side.
