title: "Transportation for kids"

Transportation of children from 3-15 will be the next sector seeing massive fundraise IMHO

1. Big market
2. Parents willing to pay a premium to ensure safety
3. Literally saving time of parents
4. Letting kids do other activities than attend school

**Disclaimer:** I originally tweeted this out in December (I think), and did not account for Covid-19. Not sure how the post Covid-19 world will look
