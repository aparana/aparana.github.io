title:  "Corporate shenanigans"
---

I read something on Reddit recently that made me think about how it feels to work in a big organisation.

As a startup scales and matures, a lot of builders get replaced by seasoned politicians who know that optics matter over everything else and they optimise for visibility and perception management vs what is good for the company. I shared it with friends who work at FAANG and we spent a lot of time discussing the implications and what it means for our own career as people who actually want to get shit done than play "the corporate game".

We don't have an answer. Yet.

Maybe 'if you can't beat them, join them' is the only optimal strategy at this point.
