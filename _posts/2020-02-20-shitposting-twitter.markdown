title: "Shitposting on Twitter"

---

Thanks to social media, it has become common for people to bring their whole personality online; not just work. I love how people like [Aaron Levie](https://twitter.com/levie), [Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk), [Chamath Palihapitiya](https://twitter.com/chamath) and [Hunter Walk](https://twitter.com/hunterwalk) joke, post memes here. IMHO it makes them more relatable

Without social media, we should assume them to be some stuck up rich executive or investor

For me at least, I can't imagine not being able to show my lighter side on Twitter

There was a time though, years back, when I used to worry about shit posting here

I used to think "What if people judge me? So many people from work follow me, what if their behavior change, and I am not taken seriously at work?

Then I realised that if [Aaron Levie can run a billion dollar company, and joke about conversations with his mom](https://twitter.com/levie/status/1248103960629506048), I (a middle manager) can probably do the same

Life is too short to take your online persona seriously anyway
