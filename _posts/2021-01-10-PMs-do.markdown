PMs focus on
- Process, People, Product, and Structure
- Produce, Organise, and Impress
- Prioritise, Scope, and Execute
- Deliver right product to the right users in the right time
- WHY, WHAT, and HOW

I have collected these from the internet over the last few years. Except the 2nd one which is lifted from a Shreyas Doshi tweet storm, I don't know who first came up with the other ones. I will keep adding to this list.
