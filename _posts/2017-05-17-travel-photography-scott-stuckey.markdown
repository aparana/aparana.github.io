**Note:** While reading a book whenever I come across something interesting, I highlight it on my Kindle. Later I turn those highlights into a blogpost. It is not a complete summary of the book. These are my notes which I intend to go back to later. Let's start!


+ Camera lens: 28-200 mm for normal photography, 400 mm for wildlife

+ Can use filters for special effects.

+ Fill the frame.

+ Think about: Foreground, Mid ground, Background.

+ Add layers.

+ Keep Rule of thirds in mind.

+ Use frames like windows.

+ Lend scale in case of landscape photography.

+ Change angle.

+ Change focal length. Telephoto lens allows to cut through the noise. And large focal length allows you to capture the complete story.

+ Maximise use of Depth of field, the point till which things are in focus.

+ Take care of lighting.

+ Front light, top lights ruin photos.

+ While side light helps to take good photos.

+ Morning and evening best for that.

+ Backlights can help in shadow photography.

+ Overcast conditions help in portrait photography.

+ Change exposure, ISO, Shutter, Aperture

+ In low lighting conditions use high ISO settings.

+ Aperture on manual. Shutter on auto. Gives more flexibility.

+ Shutter on manual. Aperture auto. For shooting motion photos.

+ Check histogram.

+ Use automatic white balance most of the times.

+ Blend flash with ambient light. Use slow sync/night mode. Bounce the flash light off a wall or other source. Use an external flash light.

+ In travel photography tell a story.

+ Take photos in the moment where people are at their natural behavior.

+ Go to new locations.

+ Go off the main tourist trail for travel photography.

+ Go early and stay till late.

+ Do prior research.

+ While shooting kids try to shoot at their level.

+ Don't try to take a photo from the top and dwarf them.

+ While shooting buildings use Skylight, street light, inside the building.

+ For traffic lights scenes, use auto exposure and 1/8 or 1/15 shutter speed.

+ Take night city photos at dusk instead.
