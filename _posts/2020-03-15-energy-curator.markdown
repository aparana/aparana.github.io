title:  "PM as energy curator"

---
I am the kind of person who likes sitting in a corner, being to myself. At work, I would probably be reading something or completing some documents. I don't chit chat much. But that led to people inferring that I don't like my team. My manager during a 1-1 also said that people get scared to approach me thinking I like to be left alone.

Why I am writing this? After a long time, I have realized how important being upbeat, and approachable is to your success as a PM. Energy is contagious. If you are a high energy PM, who looks excited to come to work, tackle big problems, then your team will also look like a reflection of you. People say culture is a reflection of the manager of the team. I say it is not just culture. It is also the energy of the team.

Remember: PM is the energy curator of the team. Your mood, your energy affects your team much more than you realize. Now that you know this. What are you going to do about it?
