title:  "Day in the life of company X"

---

I was watching [Day in the Life of a Facebook Software Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-brF6SUXbns) by Patrick Shyu, and could relate from the points he makes from 4.30 to 7.30 min in the video.

Replace X with any late-stage startup or a big company, FB for Work with Slack, and you will have the typical big co where almost everyone is engaging in shameless self-promotion, shouting matches, and taking decisions based on popularity. If you are someone who has been dreaming about working for a FANG or even a late-stage (series C+) startup, you should ask yourself if you are okay with some of the things which you will have to do as part of the job.

Note: I think a lot of videos Patrick makes are kinda lame and clickbaity. I disagree with most of his content on diversity. Also he got fired from Facebook, so his videos are biased against the company. But once in a while, he throws a video like this which makes you think.
