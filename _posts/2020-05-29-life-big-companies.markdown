title:  "Day in the life of a big company"

---

I was watching [Day in the Life of a Facebook Software Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-brF6SUXbns) by Patrick Shyu, and could relate from the points he makes from 4.30 to 7.30 min in the video.

If you are someone who has been dreaming about working for a FANG or even a late-stage startup (1000+ employees), you should ask yourself if you are okay with some of the things which you will have to do as part of the job.

Note: I think a lot of videos Patrick makes are kinda lame and clickbaity. I disagree with most of his content on diversity. Also note that since he got fired from Facebook his videos are biased against the company. But once in a while, he throws a video like this which makes you think.
