title:  "Sword fighting and corporate strategy"
---

Confession: I am tired of pretending that some book about sword fighting written by some Japanese samurai in the 1500s is going to teach me something about corporate strategy.

Earlier I used to feel guilty about not finding deeper meaning in these books. Not anymore.

It is the same with reading books about building railroads in the 1800s in the US. The Silicon valley junta finds them amazing for some reason but I seriously can't read 500 pages on it.

I would rather read books that either teaches me actionable frameworks I can use in my life or lets me escape my life ;)
