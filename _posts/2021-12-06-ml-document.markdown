title:  "ML - Document Classification"

---

Hi there 👋🏽

This is a short introduction to classify documents into categories using machine learning. 

PS - This is a draft.

Given a new document, the objective is to have a model that predicts the correct category that the document belongs to.
We have a list of pre-defined categories and the trainig is based on the same. 

We will look at different approaches and this is just one of the use-cases. The same approach can be used to auto-complete search queries or sentences. It can also be used to rank the search results and in many more ways, which we will disucss throughout the post. 

Let us start with a simple example - we need to classify the mail as spam versus non-spam.
