title: "Google Tez"

---

I don't know many companies which rebranded their products at the scale that google did with Tez (after 50 mil downloads), and literally no one had an issue.

Either Tez was a very weak name or Google Pay is 10X better at communicating what the product does.

Or maybe both.
