title: "Keeping low expectations"

---

I have read close to 600 books, at least according to Goodreads. My average rating is around 4.27. People give me a lot of shit about my high ratings. They think I rate every book 5 stars. That is maybe an exaggeration. But I do generally rate things high. It is not just books, I do the same with restaurants, service workers, and even movies on IMBD.

Why? Because I like to keep low expectations from things. I feel if there are a couple of big insights I can take away from a book, which I can incorporate in my life, and it can make me a better person, then it was worth reading 300 pages of a book, and giving 4 stars (if not 5).

My attitude is the same with people. I have friends who routinely crib about being let down by others. They would put some founder or VC on a pedestal and then feel sad when that person turns out to be a Modi supporter, or if they tweet something stupid. For me, if there is even a single thing I can learn from that person, I am happy. I don't think anyone is perfect. I would rather let them be who they are, and teach me a thing or two than expect them to be perfect.

As a PM, I do rant about usability of products, but that is a different story :)
