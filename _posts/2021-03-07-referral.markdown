title:  "How to ask for a referral"
---

**Best way to ask for a referral:**
- Go to the company's career page.
- Check out the openings.
- Don't ask multiple people at the company to refer you. Seek out just one. Find someone who is at a good level in the organization and can connect you with the Talent Acquisition team. Send a good cold email/ DM to the referrer giving some context on how you found him, develop a rapport, and give a crisp message on why the company/role is interesting to you.  
- Share the relevant opening with the referrer after making sure you fit the JD. This is supercritical. I have freshers who send JDs with 4 years minimum experience and request me to refer them. I don't even bother saying No. Just ignore them.
- Write a short pitch about yourself that the referrer can forward to the TA.
- Share your resume in PDF format. Don't send a google driver link.
- If possible ask for the work email id for the referrer and send the details there.

**Summary:** Do the bulk of the work and make it frictionless for the other person to help you. If you do this, you will find far more people willing to help you.

**Worst way to ask for a referral:**
- DM a stranger asking if their company has openings relevant for you.
- Put the onus on the other person to find a fit.
- Not even bother to read the JD and see if you have the relevant experience.
