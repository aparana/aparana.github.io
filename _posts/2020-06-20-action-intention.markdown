title:  "Action vs Intention"

---

We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their behaviour - Stephen M.R. Covey.

"Our" can be extended to people we like and our tribe. We judge people we like by their intentions and others by their behavior/actions. We judge people from our tribe by their intentions and others by their actions. That is why no matter what Elon Musk does, his fanboys will always find reasons to defend him. "Oh don't go by the actual statement X, his intent was Y". Same with Modi and his followers. You just need to spend an hour on Twitter to realise this.
