title:  "[Project Athena] Mentorship"
---

I have spent almost a year working with PMs in my team on their career dev plans. I have seen our 1-1s evolve. We have done endless gap analysis and discussed growth plans. I have also mentored a few other PMs in Gojek. Since I have enjoyed the experience so far I have decided to mentor a small group of early PMs.

**What I am thinking:**
1. Start with an hour monthly. It can be a single 1 hour or 2 half-hour slots every 2 weeks.
2. We will use the same doc I use for structured 1-1s with the PMs in my team.
3. A longer career dev plan will be discussed each quarter. We will focus on all the aspects mentioned here:Â [Career development plan for PMs](https://manassaloi.com/2020/05/11/career-dev-plan.html)
4. Unlike Aristos which had a batch size of 5, this time I don't have a number in mind. I will just mentor a few people based on my availability.
5. I don't have a time period in mind for this engagement. We can start with 3 months and see if this is helpful. If yes, we will continue. Else, we will just move on.

Basically, I will use the same docs/processes I use for running my team but instead of a PM in my team, I will be focused on your growth. This program won't be as intense as [Aristos](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/21/aristos-pm-coaching.html). This will be more of a coaching/mentorship session that me pushing you to read X articles/books by the next session.

**Why I am doing this?**
1. As I grow in my own career, I hope this will help me become a better mentor/coach/manager.
2. I want to help others. I have a few mentors in my life and I want to pay it forward.
3. It will help me connect and work with a bunch of promising PMs early in their career. If I ever need to hire people or recommend PMs to friends, I can have a pool of promising folks.4. A lot of startups don't provide the mentorship required by beginner PMs and I think this program can help fill the gap.


**Who you should be?**
1. Early PM; You should be already working as a PM. This program is not for people looking to get into Product Management.
2. Hungry to grow; You should be someone aspires to be the best in your domain.
3. Read books/blogs; You should be willing to read more books on your craft. Learning never stops in our field and getting a PM job is the start and not the end of your career.


**What do you need to do?**
1. Send me a DM on Twitter. I constantly switch between [turning my DMs on and off](https://manassaloi.com/2020/05/30/three-months-since.html). I hope if you are reading this my DMs will be on.
2. Explain how you think this will be helpful for you. Write about what you are looking for in a mentor. Send the last book you read related to your job
3. This will be a big investment of my time. As someone who calculated his hourly rate early in his career, I find it difficult to invest my time in things that don't provide high ROI. So I would want you to be dedicated and take this seriously. Come prepared for our sessions. If we don't find this useful, we will part our ways.
