Terminology
- PDG = Product Dev Group = In the context of this post it means the Transport PDG  
- Stream = A smaller group inside the PDG which looks after a specific area; Currently it is Growth and Key Initiatives for me where I lead 3 PMs
- Sub stream = Smaller pods inside a bigger stream with its own PM and TL which looks after a specific area inside the stream

Note:
- 1-1 with my own manager and my reports are sacred; rest 1-1s depends on whether there is an agenda for the week
- My long term goal is to spend around 1 day worth of time/week/ direct report
- These meetings are only the regular process meetings I attend. There are far more meetings which I organise/attend, but those are to tackle specific problems, and don't occupy a regular slot in my calendar
- IC PMs lead one of more sub streams in a PDG org but does not have direct PM reports
