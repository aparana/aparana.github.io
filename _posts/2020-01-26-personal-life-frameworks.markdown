1. [The worst case scenario](https://medium.com/desk-of-van-schneider/the-worst-case-scenario-52a348012a35#.dz3gegowc): If everything goes wrong, whats your personal worst case scenario, and is it really that bad?

2. [Write down everything](https://byrslf.co/write-down-everything-a811df6db771): Organize your thoughts. Develop your philosophy. Get ready to contribute from Day 1

3. [Avoid zero days](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af/): A zero day is when you don't do a single fucking thing towards whatever dream or goal or want or whatever that you got going on. No more zeros

4. [It Can All Go To Zero](https://feld.com/archives/2018/01/can-go-zero.html): Perspective can be a useful thing

5. [Hell Yeah](https://sivers.org/hellyeah): No “yes.” Either “HELL YEAH!” or “no.”

6. [Proximity is power](https://blog.producthunt.com/tony-robbins-the-best-advice-i-ve-ever-been-given-32e57b4b6902): Remember it, apply it. It will change your life

7. [Time Travel](https://medium.com/@bchesky/how-to-time-travel-b604096d5ed0#.hq4ojr4ci): Repetition doesn’t create memories. New experiences do

8. [FUCK YES, or no.](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-dating-advice-you-have-ever-been-given): Only pursue romantic endeavors in which everything seems to flow naturally

14. [Life is short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html): How you live affects how long you live. Most people could do better

15. [Life is a Picture, But You Live in a Pixel](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html): You doesn’t live in the picture’s broad strokes, you live at all times in a single pixel of the image—a single Today

16. [The Work Required to Have an Opinion](https://fs.blog/2013/04/the-work-required-to-have-an-opinion/): The work required to hold an opinion means that you can argue yourself better than others can

17. [Keep your identity small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html): There is a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y: not even to consider yourself an x. The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you
