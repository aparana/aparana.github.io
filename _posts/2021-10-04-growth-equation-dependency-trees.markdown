title:  "Growth equations and dependency trees: Ola"
---

This is an exercise to turn the 'how to increase orders' problem statement into a series of equations and dependency trees. This is not MECE btw. You can continue to exapand the trees mentioned here. I have chosen Ola for this exercise. Do this for your own product.
