title:  "Startup themes"
---

Like every person in tech who has ever read a PG essay, I have also thought of starting up. Some day. Here is a list of startup themes with a few ideas that interests me.

- Unbundle something (unbundle reddit)
- Play on Nostalgia (see Dispo)
- New Problem Old Solution (cold storage for crypto coins)
- IP play (Mahabharata coffee table book)
- Give superfans access (onlyfans, patreon, cameo)
- Old Problem New Solution (Consumption of erotic stories through subscription audio, VR Porn, remote operations through VR, Clubhouse)
- Reimagine a product for a particular TG (bumble: better tinder for women)
- Sell to pretend victims (Breitbart, Republic TV)
- Productised service for a TG (on demand coaching for gamers)
- Global hot trend and a routine action mashup (Improve your diet, sleep, stress, fatigue with affordable at-home lab testing)
- Underutilized Fixed Assets (parking lots, modular houses in your backyard)
- Be the arms dealers (world going remote? provide global payroll and compliance)
-  Spatial Interfaces (Teamflow,  Cosmos)
- Community plays (sneakerheads community, baseball cards community)
- New way of learning (Sketchymedical - Visual learning to crack medical)
- Big company tools (Slido for anonymous questions)
- Personal Productivity (See newer players coming to replace Forest app)
- Make things multiplayer (figma - multiplayer design)

Note: An idea can belong to multiple themes.
