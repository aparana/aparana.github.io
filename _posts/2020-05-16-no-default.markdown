title:  "No as a default"

---

Lately thinking more and more about saying NO and how it can be used as a framework for multiple things

1. [Saying NO](https://blog.intercom.io/product-strategy-means-saying-no/) as a PM.

2. [Saying No](https://manassaloi.com/2020/01/01/getting-shit-done-happiness.html) by default in personal life.

3. [Saying No to bad relationships](https://quora.com/What-is-the-best-dating-advice-you-have-ever-been-given).

4. [Saying NO to VCs](https://avc.com/2020/01/you-cant-fire-your-investor/). Because you can't fire your VC. I am not an entrepreneur but this is something I will keep in mind if I ever take the plunge.

5. [Saying no to books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/9698257?shelf=abandoned) you no longer want to read.
